The ContextualRuntimeMonitor class is optimized for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction. It utilizes an ExponentialMovingAverager to calculate latency and assesses external stress. The calculateEnvironmentalRiskFactor method computes a risk factor based on latency, external stress, and telemetry reliability, ensuring the output remains within a valid probability range.
