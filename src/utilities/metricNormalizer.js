The provided MetricNormalizer class in src/utilities/metricNormalizer.js already implements efficient normalization of raw input metrics to the required [0.0, 1.0] range using Min-Max scaling. It handles both regular and inverse metrics. However, for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction, consider the following optimizations:
