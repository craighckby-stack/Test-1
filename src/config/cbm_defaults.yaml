# CBM Defaults (S-02 Risk Mitigation Configuration)
# These define the maximum resource ceilings for System State Transitions (SSTs).
# They should be loaded by the Core component upon initialization.

# Maximum size of the SST payload (proxy for I/O and serialization cost)
max_size_bytes: 409600 # 400 KB

# Maximum estimated depth (proxy for recursion or chain length)
max_estimated_depth: 7

# Normalized complexity score budget (higher value = higher allowed risk/computation)
complexity_budget: 1.5
