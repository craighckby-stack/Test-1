Optimization of the RCDM_Validator.js file for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction is achieved through the following modifications: utilize memoization for JSON schema validation, leverage lazy loading for the schema, and implement validation caching. Additionally, consider adopting a more performant JSON Schema validator library, such as `ajv`, and configuring it for optimal performance.
