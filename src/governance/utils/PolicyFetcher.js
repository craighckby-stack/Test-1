Optimization of PolicyFetcher class for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction is crucial. The current implementation lacks robust cryptographic verification and secure HTTP client logic. To enhance this, consider integrating a cryptographically secure HTTP client library, such as axios or node-fetch with TLS validation. Additionally, implement digital signature verification using libraries like jsonwebtoken for JWT or openpgp for PGP signatures. The fetch method can be modified to accept an optional parameter for specifying the expected signature type or verification scheme, allowing for greater flexibility and recursive abstraction.
