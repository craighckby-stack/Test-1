Optimization and recursive abstraction analysis of the provided src/governance/componentLifecycleActuator.js code suggests a focus on improving computational efficiency and minimizing direct dependency access. Key aspects include the employment of a dedicated dependency router service for Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) adherence and the handling of non-reversible system modifications through staged deprecation or retirement. The code is structured to manage async stages synchronously and includes explicit state constants for process flow tracking.
