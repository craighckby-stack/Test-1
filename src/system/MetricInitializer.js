Optimization and recursive abstraction analysis executed for src/system/MetricInitializer.js. Findings indicate efficient use of static methods for validation, reducing overhead. Improvement suggestions: consider async/await for validation, integrate recursive abstraction principles for MetricInitializer class, and review telemetry adapter for potential optimization opportunities.
