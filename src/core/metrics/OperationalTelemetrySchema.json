Optimization for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction requires a fundamental reevaluation of the Operational Telemetry Schema's structural organization and logical dependencies. To achieve this goal, it's essential to focus on minimizing data redundancy, enhancing schema flexibility, and ensuring that each metric is both necessary and sufficient for the calculation of the Autonomous Efficiency Score (AES). The existing schema provides a comprehensive framework but may benefit from further abstraction to reduce complexity and enhance computational efficiency.
