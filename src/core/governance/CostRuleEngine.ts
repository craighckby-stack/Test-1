To optimize the CostRuleEngine for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction, consider the following steps: 
1. **Implement memoization** to store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again. 
2. **Apply recursive abstraction** by breaking down the evaluation process into smaller, independent functions. 
3. **Utilize a more efficient data structure**, such as a hash map, to store the metrics and their corresponding limits. 
4. **Minimize the number of iterations** by using array methods like `reduce()` and `map()` instead of traditional loops. 
5. **Implement a more efficient aggregation method**, such as using a binary tree or a heap, to reduce the time complexity of the aggregation process.
