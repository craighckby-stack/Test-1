utility_name: Deterministic State Commitment Manager
acronym: DSCM
purpose: Manages ordered, non-repudiable transaction submission of attested state fragments (e.g., Veto states, Metrics S01/S02) into the CISM.

responsibilities:
  - Enforce serialized write operations defined by GDECM stage order.
  - Implement cryptographic non-repudiation on committed fragments before CISM acceptance.
  - Provide atomic read-lock mechanisms for downstream stages relying on committed values.
