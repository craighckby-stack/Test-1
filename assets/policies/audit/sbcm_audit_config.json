The provided JSON file contains configuration settings for Sovereign Behavioral Constraint Monitoring (SBCM) audit streams, including telemetry, logging profiles, and enforcement streams. To optimize for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction, consider implementing the following: apply delta encoding for sequential telemetry data, utilize a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for performance-critical code sections, and leverage lazy loading for logging profiles and enforcement streams to minimize memory allocation and deallocation overhead. Additionally, recursive abstraction can be achieved through modularizing the configuration settings into smaller, reusable components, enabling easier maintenance and updates.
