# GEDM PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION V94.1 | Strict Prerequisite Gate (SPG)

## 1.0 DEFINITION: Axiomatic Enforcement Module

The Governance Execution Dependency Manager (GEDM) functions as the *Strict Prerequisite Gate (SPG)* for the Governance Stage Execution Protocol (GSEP). Its operation is purely transactional: assess the feasibility of a target execution stage ($S_N$) by enforcing constraints defined in the Governance Dependency & Execution Constraint Manifest (GDECM) against an **immutable** Certified Intermediate State Map (CISM).

**Core Mandate:** Synchronous, Attested State-Artifact Coherence Validation ($S_N$ Readiness Guarantee).

## 2.0 INTERFACE & GOVERNANCE STAGE STATUS PROTOCOL (ASSP)

GEDM accepts attested configuration and state references, yielding a codified status signal based on compliance.

### 2.1 REQUIRED INPUT SPECIFICATION
GEDM accepts precisely three attested, non-mutable inputs from the Stage Coordinator.

| Identifier | Type | Role | Constraint | Integrity Level |
|---|---|---|---|---| 
| Stage Index ($N$) | Int/UID | Target execution index. | Positive Integer. | Attested |
| GDECM ($C$) | Manifest Object | Artifact dependency ruleset. | Schema-Validated, Immutable Hash. | Attested |
| CISM Reference ($M$) | State Pointer | Immutable pointer to the Certified State Map. | Chain-Hashed Lock. | **Immutable** |

### 2.2 CODIFIED OUTPUT SIGNALS (ASSP)
GEDM emits a single status code upon completion.

| Code | Signal | Description | Action Mandate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **R200** | READY_TO_EXECUTE | All $\text{GDECM}(C)$ constraints fully satisfied by $\text{CISM}(M)$. | Proceed with resource allocation and $S_N$ initiation. |
| **R417** | PREREQUISITE_FAILED | One or more constraints $D_i$ were unmet. | Immediate execution halt; initiate PHM generation. |

## 3.0 VERIFICATION CRITERIA: The Coherence Axiom

Execution clearance for $S_N$ is guaranteed if and only if every declared dependency artifact $D_i$ in $C$ meets the dual conditions of **Presence** and **Integrity** within $M$.

$$\text{R200} \iff \forall D_i \in C : \text{ValidatePresence}(D_i, M) \land \text{ValidateIntegrity}(D_i)$$ 

1.  **ValidatePresence ($\mathcal{P}$):** Ensures that the artifact defined by $D_i$.Path exists and is traceable via the $\text{CISM Reference}(M)$. This guarantees artifact availability.
2.  **ValidateIntegrity ($\mathcal{I}$):** Executes a cryptographic check (e.g., SHA-256 validation) on the artifact against $D_i$.IntegrityHash, ensuring its certification and immutability have not been violated. This guarantees artifact trustworthiness.

## 4.0 ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRATION & HALT PROTOCOL

GEDM is stateless, ephemeral, and atomic. Its successful execution validates the transition boundary; its failure triggers the most critical system halt procedure.

**Halt Protocol (R417):** Upon signal R417 (PREREQUISITE_FAILED), the system must immediately abort all pending execution cycles related to $S_N$. A compulsory, hash-locked **Protocol Halt Manifest (PHM)** must be generated. The PHM details: the failure type (GEDM_FAILURE: F_STATE_INCOHERENCE), the violating dependency $D_i$, the CISM reference $M$, and the stage index $N$. This artifact secures the immutable record of why resource expenditure was prevented.

### 4.1 PROTOCOL HALT MANIFEST (PHM) SCHEMA

To ensure auditability and immutability, the PHM must conform to the following JSON structure and be cryptographically signed by the asserting module.

```json
