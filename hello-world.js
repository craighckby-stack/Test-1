• Singleton pattern (no explicit singleton in the provided code, but an `App` instance is typically treated as a single global instance in an application)
• Factory pattern (createServer, app.getInstallationOctokit)
• Mocking (nock, MockDate)
• Dependency injection (App constructor)
• Strategy pattern (Octokit.defaults, app.webhooks.on)
• Template method pattern (App class using internal methods for JWT, installation token, webhooks)
• Factory method pattern (createNodeMiddleware)
• Command pattern (app.webhooks.on listeners can be seen as commands executed upon an event)
• Observer pattern (app.webhooks.on)
• Mediator pattern (through the App class, mediating between webhooks, installations, and Octokit instances)
• Dependency inversion principle (DIP) (The `App` class depends on abstractions like `Octokit` which can be provided, rather than concrete implementations)
