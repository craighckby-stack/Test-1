• Pure Function Pattern: Demonstrated by `u32ToHex`, which consistently maps input to output without side effects, enhancing predictability and testability.
• Low-Level Optimization Strategy: `u32ToHex` uses extensive bitwise operations for performance-critical data transformation, illustrating a strategy to address computational bottlenecks with specialized, low-level techniques.
• Specialized Utility Encapsulation: `u32ToHex` encapsulates a complex, specific data conversion algorithm (u32 to packed hex string) into a reusable, self-contained function.
• Mask-Based Conditional Logic: The use of bitwise masks in `u32ToHex` to handle character mapping without explicit conditional branches (if/else) highlights a pattern for optimized, branchless logic in performance-sensitive areas.
• Fixed-Size Data Processing: `u32ToHex` operates on and returns fixed-size `u64` values, showcasing a pattern for handling data in a way that allows for predictable performance and efficient low-level manipulation.
