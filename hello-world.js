*   **Composite** (The `HttpUriOptionsAllowedUris` type allows an array containing a combination of different rule types (`RegExp`, `string`, or `AllowedUriFn`) to collectively define the set of allowed URIs.)
*   **Strategy** (The `allowedUris` property defines the strategy for URI validation by accepting a list of various rule types (`RegExp`, `string`, `AllowedUriFn`), each representing a different method of checking URI legitimacy.)
*   **Configuration Object** (The `HttpUriOptions` interface serves as a comprehensive configuration object, bundling all customizable parameters for the HTTP URI plugin.)
*   **Singleton** (The `lockfileLocation` and `cacheLocation` properties, when specified, typically point to unique, single-instance resources (a lockfile or a cache directory) within the application's operational context.)
*   **Proxy** (The `proxy` property enables the configuration of an intermediary proxy server for all outgoing HTTP requests.)
*   **Factory** (The `AllowedUriFn` type, when included in the `allowedUris` list, acts as a factory function that can programmatically generate or apply complex logic to determine allowed URIs.)
