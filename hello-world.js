• **Adapter Pattern**: The `LogStream` class acts as an adapter, transforming the interface of a simple `log_write` callable (which takes `level` and `bytes`) into the `io.RawIOBase` interface (specifically, its `write` method that takes `bytes`) as required by `io.TextIOWrapper`. This allows `SystemLog` (which inherits from `io.TextIOWrapper`) to integrate with the custom logging mechanism.

• **Facade Pattern**: The `init_streams` function serves as a facade. It provides a simplified, high-level interface (`init_streams(log_write, stdout_level, stderr_level)`) for configuring and redirecting `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr`. It hides the underlying complexity of instantiating `SystemLog` and `LogStream` objects and assigning them to the system streams.

• **Strategy Pattern**: The `log_write` parameter in the `init_streams` function (and subsequently in `LogStream`) implements the Strategy Pattern. It allows the core logging mechanism (the actual destination and method of writing bytes) to be swapped out at runtime. Different `log_write` functions can be provided to change how messages are ultimately logged (e.g., to a system log, a file, or another service) without altering the `SystemLog` or `LogStream` classes.

• **Bridge Pattern**: The `SystemLog` and `LogStream` classes, in conjunction with the `log_write` function, form a Bridge. `SystemLog` provides the abstraction for a text-based stream (handling encoding, buffering, and line splitting), while `LogStream` along with `log_write` provides the implementation for writing raw bytes to a specific destination. This separation allows the stream's text processing (abstraction) to vary independently from the underlying byte-writing mechanism (implementation).

• **Decorator Pattern**: The `SystemLog` class can be seen as a decorator around the standard `io.TextIOWrapper` functionality. While it uses inheritance, its `write` method adds specific preprocessing (splitting output into individual lines for logging) before deferring to the `io.TextIOWrapper`'s built-in handling. This enhances or "decorates" the basic text stream behavior with log-specific string manipulation.
