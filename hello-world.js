*   **Adapter Pattern**: The Python C API (e.g., `PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefault`, `PyImport_Import`, `PyObject_GetAttrString`, `PyObject_CallObject`, `PyLong_FromLong`) serves as an adapter, allowing C code to interact with and manipulate Python objects and functions by providing a C-compatible interface to the Python runtime.
*   **Factory Pattern**: The imported Python module (`pModule`), obtained through `PyImport_Import(pName)`, functions as a factory. The `pFunc` callable object (a function in this case) is retrieved from this module using `PyObject_GetAttrString(pModule, argv[2])`, effectively "producing" the desired callable product from the module factory.
*   **Facade Pattern**: `Py_Initialize()` and `Py_FinalizeEx()` act as a facade, providing a simplified, high-level interface for initializing and shutting down the complex Python interpreter subsystem, abstracting away the numerous internal processes involved.
*   **Proxy Pattern**: The `PyObject*` pointers (e.g., `pName`, `pModule`, `pFunc`, `pArgs`, `pValue`) serve as proxies or handles for the actual Python objects managed within the Python interpreter. The C code manipulates these proxies, and the Python C API functions then operate on the underlying Python objects they represent.
