• Singleton Pattern 
    This is demonstrated in Custom 3, where `Custom` class is being instantiated multiple times. While the provided KNOWLEDGE (doctests) does not explicitly verify that these instantiations return the *same object* (e.g., via `id()` checks), the accompanying text asserts that it adheres to the Singleton Pattern by returning the same object, thereby restricting the instantiation of the class to a single object.

• Dependency Injection
    No evidence of this pattern in the given code.

• Builder Pattern
    No evidence of this pattern in the given code.

• Factory Pattern 
    No evidence of this pattern in the given code.

• Prototype Pattern 
    No evidence of this pattern in the given code. The KNOWLEDGE for Custom 1 and Custom 2 shows direct instantiation of objects (e.g., `c1 = custom.Custom()`, `c2 = custom2.Custom(...)`), not cloning or creation via a prototype. There is also no "Custom 5" in the provided KNOWLEDGE.

    No evidence of this pattern in the given code.

• Visitor Pattern
    No evidence of this pattern in the given code.

• Adapter Pattern
    No evidence of this pattern in the given code.

• Decorator Pattern
    No evidence of this pattern in the given code.

• Facade Pattern
