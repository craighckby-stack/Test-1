PATTERN:
• Factory pattern: Implemented in the `setup()` function, which acts as a Simple Factory to create instances of `BPOIssue` and `GitHubIssue` classes based on the required role.
• Singleton pattern: Implemented by the instances of `BPOIssue` and `GitHubIssue` classes. Once created and registered via `app.add_role`, these specific instances are reused throughout the Sphinx application for their respective roles, acting as singletons within the role processing context.
• Strategy pattern: Implemented in `BPOIssue` and `GitHubIssue` classes, where each class encapsulates a different strategy for handling issue references (BPO vs. GitHub), adhering to the common `SphinxRole` interface.
• Plug-in architecture (extension mechanism): Implemented in the `setup()` function and `app.add_role` calls, enabling dynamic extension of Sphinx functionality by registering new roles.
