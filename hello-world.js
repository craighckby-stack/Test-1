• Singleton-like Global State: The hash function maintains a single, globally accessible instance of its internal state (`state0` to `state3`, `totalLength`) which is initialized by `init` and modified by `update` and `final`. This implicitly enforces a Singleton-like behavior for the hash context within the module.
• Pure Function Pattern: Demonstrated by `processSingle`, which consistently maps input to output without side effects, enhancing predictability and testability.
• Incremental Algorithm Pattern: The hash calculation is broken down into distinct stages (`init`, `update`, `final`) that sequentially modify and process a persistent internal state, allowing for efficient handling of large or streaming inputs.
• Low-Level Optimization Strategy: The implementation extensively uses fixed-size integer types (`u32`, `u64`), bitwise operations (like `rotl`), and direct memory access (`load`, `store`) throughout, reflecting a strategy for performance-critical data processing common in WebAssembly.
• Procedural Design Pattern: The code is structured as a series of functions that directly manipulate global state variables, representing a procedural approach to organizing the hash computation.
