•  Module-level Pattern (The `Shared`, `SharedItem`, and `SharedObject` types collectively define how modules are specified for sharing, allowing for simple string identifiers (`SharedItem`) or complex configurations grouped by `SharedObject` within the `Shared` aggregate type. This structure outlines the basic units and their aggregation for sharing within the application.)
•  Singleton Pattern (The `singleton?: boolean` property within `SharedConfig` directly implements the Singleton Pattern. When set to `true`, it ensures that only a single version of the specified shared module is allowed within the share scope, preventing multiple conflicting versions of the same module from being active simultaneously.)
•  Fallback Pattern (The `import?: false | SharedItem` property in `SharedConfig` embodies the Fallback Pattern. It specifies a module that should be provided to the share scope, and crucially, it also acts as a fallback module if no shared module is found in the share scope or if an existing shared module's version isn't valid, ensuring a module is always available.)
•  Version Constraint Pattern (The `requiredVersion?: false | string`, `strictVersion?: boolean`, and `version?: false | string` properties within `SharedConfig` implement the Version Constraint Pattern. `requiredVersion` specifies the version needed by a consumer, `version` defines the version of the provided module, and `strictVersion` enforces whether the `requiredVersion` must be strictly met, ensuring compatibility and managing dependencies.)
•  Optional Config Pattern (The design extensively uses the Optional Config Pattern. Many properties within `SharedConfig` (e.g., `eager`, `packageName`, `shareKey`) are optional. Furthermore, `SharedObject` allows for a simpler `SharedItem` (string) or a comprehensive `SharedConfig` object, enabling users to provide only the necessary configurations rather than a full boilerplate, and `SharePluginOptions` includes an optional `shareScope`.)
•  Advanced Module Configuration Pattern (The `SharedConfig` interface represents the Advanced Module Configuration Pattern. It provides a rich set of granular options—such as `eager` loading, explicit `packageName`, `shareKey` mapping, `shareScope` definition, `singleton` enforcement, and detailed version management (`requiredVersion`, `strictVersion`, `version`)—allowing for highly customized control over how individual modules are shared and consumed, far beyond a simple module name.)
