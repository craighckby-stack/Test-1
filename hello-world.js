*   **Singleton Pattern**: The Python interpreter itself, once initialized via `Py_Initialize()`, functions as a singleton within the C application process, representing the unique, global Python runtime environment for managing objects and execution.
*   **Factory Pattern**: In addition to the imported Python module functioning as a factory for callable objects, Python C API functions such as `PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefault`, `PyLong_FromLong`, and `Py_BuildValue` act as factory methods, abstracting the creation of new Python objects (string, integer, tuple) from C types.
*   **Strategy Pattern**: The C code acts as a client that dynamically selects a specific Python function by its name (`argv[2]`) from the loaded module (`pModule`). This selected function (`pFunc`) embodies a concrete strategy or algorithm that the C application chooses to invoke within the Python runtime.
*   **Adapter Pattern**: The Python C API (e.g., `PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefault`, `PyImport_Import`, `PyObject_GetAttrString`, `PyObject_CallObject`, `PyLong_FromLong`, `Py_BuildValue`) serves as an adapter, allowing C code to seamlessly interact with and manipulate Python objects and functions by providing a C-compatible interface that translates C data types and calls into Python object operations.
*   **Facade Pattern**: `Py_Initialize()` and `Py_FinalizeEx()` act as a facade, providing a simplified, high-level interface for initializing and shutting down the complex Python interpreter subsystem, abstracting away the numerous internal processes involved.
*   **Proxy Pattern**: The `PyObject*` pointers (e.g., `pName`, `pModule`, `pFunc`, `pArgs`, `pValue`) serve as proxies or handles for the actual Python objects managed within the Python interpreter. The C code manipulates these proxies, and the Python C API functions then operate on the underlying Python objects they represent, providing a necessary layer of indirection.
