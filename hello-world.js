*   **Configuration Object** (The `ProvidesConfig` interface serves as a comprehensive configuration object, bundling all customizable parameters (`eager`, `shareKey`, `shareScope`, `version`) for an individual provided shared module.)
*   **Strategy Pattern** (The `Provides` type defines the strategy for specifying modules to be provided by accepting different forms (an array of `ProvidesItem`, a `ProvidesObject` mapping to `ProvidesItem`, or a `ProvidesObject` mapping to `ProvidesConfig`), each representing a different method of defining shared module provisions. Additionally, within `ProvidesConfig`, the `shareKey` and `shareScope` properties enable the Strategy pattern by allowing users to define distinct strategies for how a provided module is identified and placed within the shared module scope.)
*   **Factory Pattern** (The `eager` property within `ProvidesConfig` aligns with the Factory Pattern, where its boolean value determines the creation strategy for the shared module. When `eager` is `true`, a factory produces an immediately available (synchronous) module, whereas `false` (or omission) leads to the creation of a lazily loaded (asynchronous) module proxy.)
*   **Dependency Injection Pattern** (The `ProvidesObject` interface facilitates the Dependency Injection Pattern. By mapping share keys to module requests (`[k: string]: ProvidesConfig | ProvidesItem`), it enables other consuming applications or modules to easily receive these shared modules as dependencies, promoting loose coupling and testability.)
*   **Template Method Pattern** (The `ProvidesConfig` interface, particularly through its `eager` option, demonstrates aspects of the Template Method Pattern. While the overarching algorithm for providing a module remains consistent, the `eager` setting allows for customization of specific steps—like immediate vs. deferred loading—within that predefined provisioning process.)
*   **Module Pattern** (The `Provides` and `ProvidesItem` types conceptually align with the Module Pattern, allowing for the clear definition and organization of self-contained units (modules) intended for sharing. `ProvidesItem` serves as a basic module identifier, while `Provides` aggregates and structures these module definitions for the plugin.)
*   **Observer Pattern** (The `ProvidesObject` interface, with its dynamic property access `[k: string]`, can be loosely associated with the Observer Pattern. When modules are declared through its properties, `ProvidesObject` acts as a 'subject' that registers their availability in the share scope, which can then be 'observed' and consumed by other parts of the application (the 'observers').)
