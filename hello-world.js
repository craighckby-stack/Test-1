• **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern**: The `glossary_search` function acts as the **Controller**, orchestrating the retrieval of data (the **Model**, fetched from `glossary.json`) and updating the user interface (**View**, by manipulating DOM elements like `glossaryTitle` and `glossaryBody`).
• **Observer Pattern**: The `document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", glossary_search)` mechanism registers `glossary_search` as an observer to the `DOMContentLoaded` event, ensuring the function executes only when the DOM is fully loaded.
• **Asynchronous Programming Pattern**: The use of `async`/`await` and the `fetch` API demonstrates an asynchronous programming pattern, allowing the application to retrieve external data (`_static/glossary.json`) without blocking the main thread.
• **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: The `glossary_search` function has a clear, single responsibility: to parse a glossary search query from the URL, fetch the corresponding glossary item, and display its details on the page.
• **Proxy Pattern**: The `fetch("_static/glossary.json")` call within the `glossary_search` function acts as a proxy, abstracting the details of making an HTTP request to an external data source and providing its content.
• **Iterator Pattern**: The `anchorLinks.forEach` method applies the Iterator Pattern, providing a way to access and modify elements of the `anchorLinks` collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
