To optimize the given logic, consider the following steps:
1. Modularize code: Break down the main function into smaller, reusable components or modules. Each module should have a specific responsibility, making the code more maintainable and efficient.
2. Implement data caching: Store frequently accessed data in a cache to reduce the number of requests made to the database or external systems, improving performance and scalability.
3. Enhance security: Validate user input to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). Implement error handling to handle unexpected errors and exceptions, ensuring the system remains stable and secure.
4. Use GitHub actions: Automate testing and deployment using GitHub actions. Create workflows that run tests, build, and deploy the application automatically when code changes are pushed to the repository, reducing manual effort and improving reliability.
