To optimize the given logic, implement the following steps:
1. Break down main components into smaller, modular functions.
2. Implement a data caching system to reduce redundant computations.
3. Validate user inputs to prevent errors.
4. Handle errors using try-except blocks.
5. Automate tests and deployments using GitHub Actions.
