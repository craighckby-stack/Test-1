Absorption of the MEE Metric Evaluation framework is complete. This framework, now integrated as the core indexing engine, provides standardized, weighted, multi-source calculation capabilities. The engine supports asynchronous data sourcing via mapped providers and performs iterative component summation to derive complex metrics (R_INDEX, SCI). Crucially, the framework enables dynamic threshold comparison, essential for the MutationGateController's compliance enforcement and risk assessment capabilities, allowing immediate trigger evaluation based on defined static_max thresholds and associated adjustment_factor mitigation logic. Advanced metric post-processing (normalization, adjustment factoring) is now standard for all calculated indices.
