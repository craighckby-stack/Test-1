Implement a hybrid approach combining Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) with heuristic functions like A* or Greedy Best-First Search to optimize node exploration. Utilize a set data structure for visited nodes and a priority queue for node selection, where the priority of each node is determined by its heuristic value (f(n) = g(n) + h(n)) and depth. This approach will allow for more efficient exploration of the search space by leveraging the benefits of both IDDFS and heuristic search.
