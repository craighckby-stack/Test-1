Absorption of M-02 Mutation Pre-Processor (MPP) logic. The functionality is integrated as the `MutationGateController` (MGC), serving as the GSEP Stage 2 efficiency gate. This module implements mandatory compliance checks, risk assessment (`R_INDEX`) calculation based on weighted rule penalties, and delegation via a `RuleExecutorRegistry` (mocked for structural integrity). Governance constants have been updated to include necessary rules and the MPP pass threshold. The Strategic Cost Indexer (SCI) implementation has also been completed.
