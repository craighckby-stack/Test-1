Implement a hybrid approach combining IDDFS with heuristic functions like A* or Greedy Best-First Search to optimize node exploration. Utilize a set data structure for visited nodes and a priority queue for node selection, where the priority of each node is determined by its heuristic value and depth. This approach will allow for more efficient exploration of the search space.
