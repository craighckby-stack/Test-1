### ASTH: Architectural Staging & Testing Harness

**Acronym:** ASTH
**Phase:** P-2 (Evolution & Commitment)
**GSEP Relevance:** L3, L6
**Interface Topic (API):** `synthesis.staging.validate`
**Dependencies:** ASP, PSR, GCO (CIP), SDR (TRP)
**Role:** Mandatory (M)

**Primary Function:** ASTH provides a segregated, virtualized environment to stress-test architectural modification plans generated by the ASP against both historical data (L3) and current operational constraints (L6). It validates the projected efficacy metrics stored in the PSR and ensures proposed changes adhere to L6 safety veto thresholds defined by the GCO before the artifact is handed to AMA for activation. This step is critical for minimizing system risk during self-modification.
