This file is critical documentation defining the structure and functional contracts of the SOVEREIGN AGI system (COMPONENT_REGISTRY). As it is pure architectural documentation (Markdown) and not functional JavaScript logic, no modification, refactoring for UNIFIER.js compatibility, or deletion is required. It serves as the immutable blueprint for all mandated component interactions and protocols (TRP/CIP).
