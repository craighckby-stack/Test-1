## AGI-KERNEL V7.X: ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENT REGISTRY (ACR)

This registry formally catalogs mandatory, versioned operational interfaces and functional contracts, structured by their role within the Autonomous Evolutionary Cycle (AEC). All components are mandatory (M), read-only (R), or optional (O).

Compliance is enforced exclusively via the Governance Evolution Protocol (GSEP) constraints. All components adhere to two standardized protocols:
1. **Telemetry & Reporting Protocol (TRP):** Reports state and diagnostics to the System Diagnostic & Reporting (SDR) component.
2. **Control & Instruction Protocol (CIP):** Receives instruction and constraint parameters from the Governance Constraint Orchestrator (GCO).

---

### CORE METRICS & DERIVATION CONTRACTS (CMD)
*These functional contracts calculate core integrity, risk, and compliance metrics derived from TRP telemetry streams, driving constraint arbitration (M: Mandatory, R: Read-Only).

| ID | Description | Primary Data Provider (TRP Source) | Derived Metrics | CIP Consumers (Instruction Recipients) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **CMD-101** | Trust/Integrity Score Calculation | ATM, SDR | T_Index, I_Delta | MCRA, RSAM (Conflict Weighting) |
| **CMD-102** | Operational Risk Index Calculation | MCRA, SDR | R_Index, L4_Tolerance | GCO (Constraint Update), AMA (Activation Halt) |
| **CMD-103** | Policy Veto Threshold Derivation | RSAM, CIL | Veto_Score, L1_Compliance | CIL (Controls Immediate Execution Suspension) |
| **CMD-104** | Artifact Lineage Vector Generation | ACM, AIA | Hash_Vector, Provenance_ID | ACM (Validates History), AMA (Commit ID) |

| **ACM** | Artifact Chain Manager | L2, L5 | `provenance.chain.log` | M | Validates and anchors the lineage (L5 audit) of all evolving artifacts utilizing CMD-104. |

### PHASE 1: ARBITRATION & CONSTRAINT GOVERNANCE (P-1)
