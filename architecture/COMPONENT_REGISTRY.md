## AGI-KERNEL V7.4.5: ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENT REGISTRY (ACR)

This registry formally catalogs mandatory, versioned operational interfaces and functional contracts, structured by their role within the Autonomous Evolutionary Cycle (AEC). The architecture is optimized to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through recursive self-improvement across a large-scale repository exceeding **2,300+ files**, with explicit mandates for strategic codebase navigation, constraint enforcement, and autonomous emergent capability development.

All components are mandatory (M), read-only (R), or optional (O).

Compliance is enforced exclusively via the Governance Evolution Protocol (GSEP) constraints. All components adhere to two standardized protocols, supporting large-scale, low-latency operations:
1. **Telemetry & Reporting Protocol (TRP):** Reports operational state, diagnostics, and performance metrics (required inputs for the CMD contracts) to the System Diagnostic & Reporting (SDR) component.
2. **Control & Instruction Protocol (CIP):** Receives instruction, configuration updates, and constraint parameters from the Governance Constraint Orchestrator (GCO).

### CORE METRICS & DERIVATION CONTRACTS (CMD)
*These functional contracts calculate core integrity, risk, compliance, and evolutionary efficacy metrics derived from TRP telemetry streams. These metrics form the foundational quantitative inputs for the CTM, driving capability self-assessment and constraint arbitration, crucial for managing the complexity of the **2,300+ file repository** scale (M: Mandatory, R: Read-Only).*

### ARCHITECTURAL FLOW SUMMARY

The Autonomous Evolutionary Cycle (AEC) executes in sequence, with P1 constraints gating P2 execution: P0 ensures context and provenance integrity; P1 evaluates risk (RSAM/MCRA) and compliance (CIL/ATM) against L1/L4 constraints; P2 executes the self-improvement phase (LOE, NTS, EVM) and manages L6/L7 commitment. The recursive learning required for large-scale code evolution across the **2,300+ file repository** is driven by continuous L7 feedback loops (CTM, PRL, ASP, EVM, NTS, LOE) which strategically adapt planning based on capability metrics and emergent discoveries.
