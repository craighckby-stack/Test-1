To optimize the PolicySchemaValidator for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction, the following steps can be taken: 1) Utilize a robust JSON schema validation library like Ajv to validate the proposed policy updates and configurations. 2) Implement memoization to store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again. 3) Apply recursive abstraction by breaking down the validation logic into smaller, more manageable functions. 4) Leverage parallel processing or asynchronous validation to improve performance when dealing with large policy updates or configurations.
