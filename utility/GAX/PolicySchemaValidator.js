Optimizing PolicySchemaValidator for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction involves utilizing a robust JSON schema validation library like Ajv, implementing memoization to store and reuse results of expensive function calls, applying recursive abstraction to break down validation logic into smaller functions, and leveraging parallel or asynchronous processing for improved performance with large policy updates.
