Optimizing the provided Formal Verification Engine code for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction involves enhancing the `_generateConstraintModel` function to effectively utilize SAT/SMT solvers and improving the `checkConsistency` method to asynchronously integrate with these solvers. To achieve parity, we should focus on the following steps:
