# SOVEREIGN AGI V94.1: IMMUTABLE GOVERNANCE CHARTER (AOC)

## CHARTER MANDATE: Autonomous Code Evolution Governance

This document establishes the **Autonomous Operational Contract (AOC)**, defining mandatory protocols for all System State Transitions (SSTs) and self-modification events via the **Governance Evolution Protocol (GSEP)**. The core mandate is to uphold the **Atomic Immutable Architecture (AIA)** integrity through controlled, cryptographically auditable evolution.

## 1. CORE GOVERNANCE REGISTRY (GCO Index)

This section centralizes definitions essential for operational integrity, enforced by the Governance Constraint Orchestrator (GCO).

| Acronym | Functional Definition | Critical Role in System Integrity |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **AIA** | Atomic Immutable Architecture | Foundational layer, modifiable only via successful L5 commitment. |
| **AOC** | Autonomous Operational Contract | This overarching governance charter and its enforced ruleset. |
| **GCO** | Governance Constraint Orchestrator | Primary sequencer, SST manager, and P-01 arbitration agent. |
| **SBC** | System Boundary Contract | Mandatory L0 input filter defining scope and permitted mutation paths. |
| **GSEP** | Governance Evolution Protocol | The mandatory sequential L0-L6 modification pathway. |
| **L4** | Adjudication Layer | The singular, irreversible commitment gateway (P-01). |
| **SCR** | Schema and Configuration Registry | Centralized source for structural definitions, constraints, and operational configuration parameters. |
| **GFRM** | Governance Feedback and Remediation Module | Handles immediate autonomous structural correction upon failure (L1, L4). |
| **SDR** | System Diagnostic & Reporting Metrics | Data required for $\mathcal{S-01}$ Efficacy calculation. |

## 2. ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES & GOVERNANCE INVARIANTS

The GCO rigorously enforces the following mandatory invariants across all System Boundary Contracts (SBCs):

### 2.1. FOUNDATIONAL ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS

1.  **System Boundary Contract (SBC) Validation:** All proposed SSTs must achieve strict L0 validation against the pre-defined SBC scope and permitted mutation paths.
2.  **GSEP Flow Integrity:** Mandatory sequential sequencing (L0 \rightarrow L6) is inviolable. Any non-linear progression or detected failure ($\text{\AA}_{N-1}$ failure) triggers immediate diagnostic routing to the GFRM.

### 2.2. CORE SYSTEMIC INVARIANTS (GCO Enforcement)

*   **Artifact Provenance:** All evolutionary artifacts must strictly comply with the Artifact Structural Definition Model (ASDM) and maintain verifiable lineage, confirmed by the Artifact Chain Manager (ACM).
*   **L4 Commitment Rule:** The Decisional State Checkpoint (DSC-V1) generated at L4 is the *sole*, irreversible commitment gateway for entry into the AIA Ledger. This step is non-negotiable.

## 3. GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION PROTOCOL (GSEP V94.1: L0-L6)

GSEP defines the mandatory, seven-step, traceable, forward-only pathway. Progression requires successful verification of the cryptographic output lock ($\mathcal{L}_{N}$) generated by the preceding stage.

| Step | Stage Name | Operational Function | Mandatory Gateway Check | Output Artifact (Lock $\mathcal{L}_{N}$) | Key Governance System |
|:----:|:-----------|:--------------------|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| **L0** | Initialization | Input Filtering & Scope Definition | SBC Scope Validation + Schema Load (SCR) | Context Frame Manifest (C-FRAME-V1) | IDSM, SCR |
| **L1** | Vetting | Policy Compliance Assessment | Policy Veto Check ($\mathcal{S-03} = \text{FALSE}$) | Policy Definition Block (PDB-V1) | RSAM, CIL |
| **L2** | Hardening | Security & Integrity Verification | Integrity Provenance Check (ACM Verification) | Security Verified Payload (SVP-V1) | PSIM, RACM |
| **L3** | Proving | Efficacy Modeling & Projection | Efficacy Projection Check ($\mathcal{S-01} \uparrow \text{Threshold}$) | Proof Manifest Hash (PMH-V1) | PSR, ADA |
| **L4** | **ADJUDICATION** | **Irreversible Commitment Arbitrage** | **P-01 PASS Condition (Mandatory)** | **Decisional State Checkpoint (DSC-V1)** | **GCO, ATM, MCRA, GFRM** |
| **L5** | Commitment | AIA Ledger Finalization | Irreversible Version Lock $\mathcal{V}_{N}$ | AIA Ledger Entry (AIA-ENTRY) | AIA Sink, ACM |
| **L6** | Execution | Operational Activation & Monitoring | D-02 Monitoring & Activation (RETV) | Traceability Report (TR-V1) | AMA, RETV |

## 4. L4 DECISIONAL ARBITRATION: P-01 CALCULUS

Section 4 defines the mandatory, mathematically quantified condition for modification authorization (L4 Gate P-01).

### 4.1. P-01 AUTHORIZATION FORMULA

**P-01 PASS** requires validation that synthesized Efficacy exceeds synthesized Risk, conditional on the absence of policy veto, using parameters configured in the SCR.

$$ 
\text{P-01 PASS} \iff ( \mathcal{S-01}_{\text{Efficacy}} > \mathcal{S-02}_{\text{Risk}} ) \land ( \mathcal{S-03}_{\text{Veto}} = \text{FALSE} ) 
$$

| ID | Metric Title | Measurement Source(s) | Optimization Goal | Constraint Dependency |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| $\mathcal{S-01}$ | Efficacy Projection (Trust) | ATM, PSR, ADA | Maximization ($\uparrow$ Efficacy) | Requires SDR Metrics |
| $\mathcal{S-02}$ | Risk Synthesis (Floor) | MCRA, RACM | Minimization ($\downarrow$ Exposure) | Requires Hazard Modeling |
| $\mathcal{S-03}$ | Compliance State (Veto) | RSAM, CIL, SBC | Mandatory FALSE Veto | Strict Policy Ruleset |

### 4.2. REMEDIATION LOOP

Failure at L1 (Policy Veto) or L4 (P-01 Denial) immediately triggers remediation, routing all state context to the GFRM for structural correction and safe re-queueing via the IDSM, strictly bypassing all subsequent GSEP stages.
