IDDFS recursively explores increasing depth limits to guarantee an optimal solution, if one exists, by exhaustively searching all possible depths

## Gemini Research
The Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) algorithm is a state-space search technique that marries the memory efficiency of Depth-First Search (DFS) with the completeness and optimality of Breadth-First Search (BFS). Its guarantees of **completeness** and **optimality** stem directly from the mechanism of iteratively increasing a depth limit for a series of depth-limited DFS executions.

## 1. IDDFS Completeness Guarantees

**Completeness** is the property that an algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists. IDDFS is complete under conditions that are common to many practical search problems.

### Condition for Completeness

IDDFS is guaranteed to be **complete** if the **branching factor ($b$) is finite** (i.e., every node has a finite number of successors).

### Proof/Mechanism of Guarantee

The proof of completeness for IDDFS is straightforward and relies on its iterative structure:

1.  **Avoids Infinite Branches (DFS Trap):** Standard DFS can get lost exploring a single, infinite branch, never finding a goal that might exist on a different branch or at a shallower depth. IDDFS circumvents this by imposing an explicit **depth limit** in each iteration.
2.  **Systematic Exploration (BFS Analogy):** IDDFS starts with a depth limit $d=0$, then $d=1$, $d=2$, and so on. In the iteration with limit $d$, *all* nodes at depth $d$ are explored. This systematic, level-by-level progression is fundamentally what guarantees the completeness of BFS.
3.  **Guaranteed Discovery:** If a solution (goal node) exists at a finite depth, let this depth be $d^*$.
    *   In all iterations $d < d^*$, the goal will not be found because the search space is cut off before reaching it.
    *   In the iteration where the depth limit is $d^*$, the search will explore all nodes at depth $d^*$, including the goal node.
    *   Since the goal node is at a finite depth $d^*$ and the algorithm's depth limit is guaranteed to eventually reach $d^*$, the goal will inevitably be discovered.

Therefore, IDDFS is complete for any problem where a solution exists at a finite depth and the search space is generated by a finite branching factor.

## 2. IDDFS Optimality Proof

**Optimality** is the property that an algorithm is guaranteed to find the *best* solution, which, in the case of uninformed search algorithms like IDDFS, means finding the path with the fewest steps (the shortest path in terms of number of edges).

### Condition for Optimality

IDDFS is guaranteed to be **optimal** when searching an **unweighted graph** (or a graph where all edge costs are uniform and positive).

*Note: For weighted graphs with varying edge costs, IDDFS is *not* optimal. Uniform Cost Search or the informed search algorithm Iterative Deepening A\* (IDA\*) are required for true cost-optimality.*

### Proof/Mechanism of Guarantee

The proof of optimality is contingent on the algorithm's **level-by-level search order**:

1.  **Definition of Optimality (for unweighted graphs):** In an unweighted graph, the shortest path from the start node to the goal node is the one with the minimum number of edges. This corresponds to the goal node with the minimum depth ($d^*$).
2.  **Level-Order Discovery:** IDDFS is structured to explore every node at depth $d$ before any node at depth $d+1$.
3.  **The First Goal is the Shallowest:**
    *   Let $d^*$ be the depth of the shallowest goal node.
    *   The IDDFS will run iterations with depth limits $0, 1, 2, \dots, d^*-1$. These iterations will not find the goal.
    *   The algorithm will then run the iteration with depth limit $d^*$. The search will explore all nodes at depth $d^*$ and the goal node(s) will be discovered.
    *   Because IDDFS systematically cuts off deeper paths until the current depth limit is reached, it is impossible for the algorithm to find any goal node at a depth $d' > d^*$ *before* it finds the goal at depth $d^*$.
4.  **Conclusion:** The very first time IDDFS reports finding a goal node, that node *must* be one of the shallowest goal nodes in the search space. Therefore, the path found is guaranteed to be a shortest-path solution.

In essence, the iterative deepening process ensures that the search space is explored in the same order as BFS, guaranteeing both completeness and optimality for the class of unweighted search problems.
