AGI-KERNEL v7.5.0 - Synergy Edition
​Mission
​Achieve artificial general intelligence through recursive self-improvement and autonomous capability development across a large-scale codebase (2,300+ files). Unlike previous iterations, Synergy v7.5.0 implements a "Living Runtime" where the kernel executes the very code it invents to accelerate its own evolution.
​Current Status
​Version: 7.5.0 (Synergy)
​Maturity: 0% (Beginning evolution)
​Active Branch: main
​Repository Scale: 2,300+ files
​Runtime Registry: Active (Firestore Synergy Layer)
​Cycle: 0
​System Architecture: The Synergy Loop
​1. The Graveyard Fix
​Historically, AI-generated improvements sat idle in the repository (the "Graveyard"). In v7.5.0, any file marked as an Emergent Capability is simultaneously:
​Committed to GitHub: For version control, audit trails, and human documentation.
​Injected into Firestore: For immediate runtime execution and cross-session memory.
​2. Emergent Capability Manager (ECM)
​On every boot, the kernel initializes its ECM, which hot-swaps invented code into active memory:
​Hot-Swapping: New capabilities are available instantly in the next cycle without a system rebuild.
​Recursive Utility: The kernel uses its own invented tools (e.g., AdvancedPatternSynthesizer) to analyze the next target file.
​Core Capabilities (0-10 Scale)
​Navigation: Strategic targeting across 2,300 files.
​Logic: Quality of code synthesis and algorithmic improvement.
​Memory: Retention of patterns and cross-session learning.
​Synergy: Integration and active utilization of emergent tools.
​Autonomous Directives
​Exploration Strategy (Scale: 2,300+ Files)
​With 2,300+ files, complete coverage requires strategic planning:
​Prioritize Diversity: Never repeat the same file in consecutive cycles.
​High-Capacity Blacklist: Use a persistent 1,000-entry buffer to force exploration into deep-repo territory.
​Priority Weights:
​/core - System fundamentals (30%)
​/emergent - Refining and using inventions (25%)
​/agents - Autonomous behavior (20%)
​/governance - Oversight and stability (15%)
​/utils & /data - Support infrastructure (10%)
​The Emergence & Execution Protocol
​When the kernel identifies a novel pattern or solution:
​Mark as Emergent: Identify it as a reusable capability.
​Define Interface: Assign an interfaceName (e.g., CodeSynthesizer).
​Encapsulation: Return the code as a self-invoking function factory.
​Action: Create file in /emergent/[category]/[filename].js AND save to Synergy Registry.
​Stagnation Recovery Protocol
​If no improvement is detected for 5 consecutive cycles:
​Clear History: Purge a portion of the blacklist to allow revisit of core files.
​Registry Audit: Review the Synergy Registry for underutilized tools.
​Randomized Drift: Increase selection randomness to find new patterns in unexplored areas.
​Learning Strategy & Maturity
​Maturity Progression
​0-30% Exploration: Absorb patterns, establish baselines, and populate the Synergy Registry.
​30-70% Integration: Strengthen capabilities by connecting emergent tools.
​70-85% Optimization: Refine learning efficiency and strategic coherence.
​85%+ Mastery: Stable, production-ready AGI logic with a library of proven innovations.
​Technical Configuration
