## 1.0 GOVERNANCE STATE EVOLUTION PIPELINE (GSEP-C V3.5)

The GSEP-C V3.5 is a sequential, ten-stage (PRE, L0-L9) enforcement mechanism. It guarantees deterministic, auditable governance adherence to the **Principle of Immutable Staging (Fail-Fast)**. Any failure triggers the immediate Rollback and Recovery Protocol (RRP).

Mandatory, high-security enforcement checkpoints are marked in **bold**.

| Stage | ID Tag | Stage Title | Core Validation Objective | Halt Trigger | Axiom/Metric Link |
|:-----|:---|:---|:-----------------------------------|:------------------------------|:---|
| PRE | GSC | Schema Ingress | Assert structural integrity against the data model. | Invalid Schema Structure | N/A |
| L0 | CTM | Context Typing | Formal format and schema compliance verification. | Format Integrity Fail | N/A |
| **L1** | **PVLM** | **CRITICAL VETO** | Policy Violation Assessment (S-03 generation). | **CRITICAL POLICY VIOLATION** | S-03 |
| **L2** | **CTAL** | **Provenance Trust** | Source authenticity, lineage, and cryptographic trust validation. (Requires DTEM V1.0) | Provenance Trust Failure | N/A |
| L3 | CM | Confidence Modeling | Simulate impact bounds and confidence margins. | Simulation Divergence | N/A |
| **L4** | **SCI** | **Resource Constraint** | Verification against Core Architectural Limits (CAC). | **Budget Threshold Exceeded** | N/A |
| L5 | DFV | Data Fidelity | Input data lineage, source chain, and integrity check. (Requires DTEM V1.0) | Data Corruption | N/A |
| L6 | MEE | Metric Synthesis | Quantify objective metrics (S-01: Efficacy, S-02: Risk). | Metric Synthesis Failure | S-01, S-02 |
| **L7** | **VMO** | **FINALITY GATE** | Enforce GAX-CERT (P-01 Certification Check). | **FINALITY RULE BREACH** | GAX-EVAL, GAX-CERT |
| L8 | GRLC | Certified Persistence | Record, notarize, and verify auditable transaction log. | Persistence Logging Failure | N/A |
| L9 | TEDC | Execution & Decommitment | Final compliance sign-off and atomic state trigger. | Runtime Threshold Breach | N/A |

## 2.0 GOVERNANCE AXIOMS (GAX) & THRESHOLD DEPENDENCY (CFTM)

The immutable prerequisites enforced by L6 and L7 that dictate SST certification. All thresholds ($\tau_{norm}, \epsilon$) are defined in the **Core Failure Thresholds Manifest (CFTM)**.

### 2.1 GAX-EVAL: Core Objective Function (Optimization Target)

Maximizes the transition's objective value. $S\text{-}02$ is normalized by $\tau_{norm}$ (sourced from CFTM) to ensure stability in low-risk environments.

$$ \text{COF}: \max \left( \frac{S\text{-}01}{S\text{-}02 + \tau_{norm}} \right) $$

### 2.2 GAX-CERT: P-01 Finality Certification (L7 Enforcement)

Certification ($\mathbf{P\text{-}01\ PASS}$) is achieved only if benefit ($S\text{-}01$) strictly outweighs adjusted risk ($S\text{-}02$) by the Safety Margin ($\epsilon$), and no critical veto signal ($S\text{-}03$) is present.

$$ \mathbf{P\text{-}01\ PASS} \iff (S\text{-}01 > S\text{-}02 + \epsilon) \land (\neg S\text{-}03) $$

Where $\epsilon \ge \epsilon_{min}$ (Safety Margin) is sourced directly from the CFTM.

## 3.0 GOVERNANCE ASSET AND CONTRACT REGISTRY (GACR)

Standardized identifiers and system dependencies critical for deterministic pipeline execution.

### 3.1 Governance Input Signals (S-Metrics)

S-Metrics are generated by L1 (PVLM) and L6 (MEE) and consumed by L7 (VMO) and GAX-EVAL/CERT.

*   **S-01 (Efficacy):** Quantified Systemic Benefit/Value ($\ge 0$).
*   **S-02 (Risk):** Quantified Systemic Risk/Cost ($\ge 0$).
*   **S-03 (Veto Signal):** Boolean flag indicating critical policy violation.
