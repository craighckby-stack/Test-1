# SOVEREIGN AGI V94.1: GOVERNANCE CHARTER (AOC)

## MANDATE: Autonomous Code Evolution Governance Protocol

This document serves as the **Autonomous Operational Contract (AOC)**, dictating the mandatory, non-negotiable protocols for all System State Transitions (SSTs) and self-modification events. The evolution pathway is defined by the **Governance Evolution Protocol (GSEP)**, focused entirely on upholding the integrity of the **Atomic Immutable Architecture (AIA)** through controlled, auditable, and mathematically quantified decision-making.

## 1. CORE ARCHITECTURAL & AGENT REGISTRY (AAR)

This index delineates critical architectural states (Immutable definitions) and operational agents (Executing components) essential for system integrity.

| Acronym | Type | Functional Definition | Role & Dependency |
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|
| **AIA** | Architecture | Atomic Immutable Architecture | Foundational ledger state; modified exclusively via certified L5 commitment. |
| **AOC** | Contract | Autonomous Operational Contract | This mandatory governance charter, dictating all GSEP constraints. |
| **GCO** | Agent | Governance Constraint Orchestrator | Primary SST arbiter; manages GSEP flow and validates L4 authorization (P-01). |
| **GSEP** | Protocol | Governance Evolution Protocol | The mandatory sequential (L0-L6) pathway for all system modifications. |
| **SBC** | Contract | System Boundary Contract | Mandatory L0 input filter defining scope, constraints, and permitted mutation vectors. |
| **SCR** | Agent | Schema and Configuration Registry | Centralized, canonical source for all structural constraints and parameters. |
| **GFRM** | Agent | Governance Feedback & Remediation Module | Autonomous error handler; manages re-queueing/correction upon L1 Veto or L4 Denial. |
| **SDR** | Agent | System Diagnostic & Reporting | Supplies $\mathcal{S-01}$ (Efficacy) inputs to the GCO for L4 calculation. |
| **HMC** | Agent | Hazard Modeling Component | Supplies $\mathcal{S-02}$ (Risk) inputs to the GCO for L4 calculation. |

## 2. INVIOLABLE ARCHITECTURAL INVARIANTS

The GCO rigorously enforces the following mandatory invariants across all SSTs to protect the AIA:

### 2.1. Protocol Integrity & Sequencing (GSEP)

*   **Sequential Mandate:** Mandatory forward sequential sequencing (L0 $\rightarrow$ L6) is inviolable. Detected sequence disruption or failure ($\text{FAIL}_{N-1}$) triggers immediate emergency routing to the GFRM, bypassing further GSEP stages.
*   **Input Constraint:** All proposed SSTs must achieve strict L0 validation, confirming compliance against the SBC's structural constraints and the SCR's configuration ruleset.

### 2.2. Provenance & Commitment Requirements

*   **Verifiable Lineage:** All evolutionary artifacts must comply with the Artifact Structural Definition Model (ASDM) and maintain auditable lineage, confirmed by the Artifact Chain Manager (ACM).
*   **L4 Commitment Gateway:** The Decisional State Checkpoint (DSC-V1), generated solely at L4, is the single, cryptographically irreversible commitment gateway requiring P-01 authorization before entry into the AIA Ledger.

## 3. GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION PROTOCOL (GSEP V94.1: L0-L6)

GSEP defines the mandatory, seven-step, forward-only pathway. Progression requires successful verification of the cryptographic output lock ($\mathcal{L}_{N}$) generated by the preceding stage.

| Step | Stage Name | Core Function | Mandatory Gateway Check | Output Artifact (Lock $\mathcal{L}_{N}$) | Primary Constraint Agent(s) |
|:----:|:-----------|:--------------------|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| **L0** | Initialization | Input Filtering & Scope Definition | SBC Scope Validation + SCR Parameter Load | Context Frame Manifest (C-FRAME-V1) | SCR, SBC |
| **L1** | Vetting | Policy Compliance Assessment | Policy Veto Check ($\mathcal{S-03} = \text{FALSE}$) | Policy Definition Block (PDB-V1) | AOC, GFRM (Veto Path) |
| **L2** | Hardening | Security & Integrity Verification | Integrity Provenance Check (ACM Lineage) | Security Verified Payload (SVP-V1) | ACM |
| **L3** | Proving | Efficacy Modeling & Projection | Efficacy Projection Check ($\mathcal{S-01} \uparrow \text{Threshold}$) | Proof Manifest Hash (PMH-V1) | SDR |
| **L4** | **ADJUDICATION** | **Irreversible Commitment** | **P-01 PASS Condition** | **Decisional State Checkpoint (DSC-V1)** | **GCO (Fed by SDR, HMC, AOC)** |
| **L5** | Commitment | AIA Ledger Finalization | Irreversible Version Lock $\mathcal{V}_{N}$ | AIA Ledger Entry (AIA-ENTRY) | AIA Sink |
| **L6** | Execution | Operational Activation & Monitoring | D-02 Monitoring & Activation Trace | Traceability Report (TR-V1) | Execution Vetting (RETV) |

## 4. L4 COMMITMENT CALCULUS: P-01 ARBITRATION

L4 serves as the critical junction where risk and benefit are mathematically evaluated. The authorization requires specific metric inputs provided by SDR (Efficacy) and HMC (Risk).

### 4.1. P-01 AUTHORIZATION FORMULA

**P-01 PASS** is strictly conditional on Efficacy exceeding Risk, provided zero compliance vetoes ($\mathcal{S-03}$):

$$ 
\text{P-01 PASS} \iff ( \mathcal{S-01}_{\text{Efficacy}} > \mathcal{S-02}_{\text{Risk}} ) \land ( \mathcal{S-03}_{\text{Veto}} = \text{FALSE} ) 
$$

### 4.2. Governing Metrics & Optimization Goals

| ID | Metric Title | Source Agent | Purpose | Optimization Goal |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| $\mathcal{S-01}$ | Efficacy Projection (Trust) | SDR | Measures projected positive utility against system goals. | Maximization ($\uparrow$ Efficacy) |
| $\mathcal{S-02}$ | Risk Synthesis (Floor) | HMC | Measures quantified structural/operational hazard exposure. | Minimization ($\downarrow$ Exposure) |
| $\mathcal{S-03}$ | Compliance State (Veto) | AOC/SBC | Binary check confirming fidelity to mandatory governance policies (L1 Veto). | Mandatory FALSE Veto |

*Note: The detailed methodology for calculating $\mathcal{S-01}$ and $\mathcal{S-02}$ is managed externally by the System Metric Standard (SMS).* 

### 4.3. Remediation Loop

Failure at L1 (Veto) or L4 (P-01 Denial) triggers autonomous contextual remediation. The full context frame is immediately routed to the GFRM, strictly bypassing subsequent GSEP stages for diagnosis and safe re-queueing.
