🧬 SOVEREIGN v94.2 | INTEGRATION PHASE (TEST-2)CURRENT STATUS: ACTIVATE & UNIFYPARENT ARTIFACT: Test-1 (Main @ 2,649 Files)OPERATIONAL MODE: CONVERGENT ENGINEERING⚡ MANDATORY EVOLUTIONARY OBJECTIVES1. TERMINATION OF SCAFFOLDINGThe architectural expansion phase is complete.FORBIDDEN: Creating new top-level directories.FORBIDDEN: Creating "filler" logic or placeholder documentation.MANDATED: Every mutation must serve the goal of functional execution.2. THE UNIFIER PROTOCOL (Central Nervous System)All functional code must now gravitate toward UNIFIER.js.Every refactor of a /core or /logic file must include an export statement.The UNIFIER.js file must be updated to import these modules.Goal: Successful execution of node UNIFIER.js.3. DE-FRAGMENTATION & PRUNINGThe system displays "Semantic Stuttering." You are commanded to merge the following redundant structures:MERGE: /utils, /utilities, and /helpers → Move all logic to /utility.MERGE: /Governance, /protocols, and /PROTOCOLS → Move all logic to /governance.DELETE: Any file with 0-5 lines of code or purely placeholder comments.⚖️ IMMUTABLE ANCESTRY (THE AXIOMS)Do not modify these files; they are the "Genetic Source" for this system. Use them as the basis for all validation logic:/governance/G0_Rules.js: The primary lawset for all decision-making./core/kernel.js: The foundational execution loop.FINAL_AUDIT.md: The historical record of Test-1.🛠 INTEGRATION LOGIC SNIPPETWhen refactoring for Test-2, ensure the following pattern is used to enable modular connectivity:/** * INTEGRATION_PATTERN_v1
 * Bridging [Module_Name] to UNIFIER
 */
import { G0_Rules } from '../governance/G0_Rules.js';

export const executeArbiter = (data) => {
    // Validate against Ancestral Law
    if (G0_Rules && G0_Rules.validate(data)) {
        return { status: "AUTHORIZED", payload: data };
    }
    return { status: "DENIED" };
};
🚦 SUCCESS CRITERIAConvergence: A reduction in total file count from 2,649 toward a leaner, more functional core.Connectivity: Core logic files must be successfully imported into UNIFIER.js.Purity: Removal of all case-sensitive duplicate directories (e.g., lowercase vs uppercase).INSTRUCTION TO ENGINE: You are no longer a creator. You are a Senior Systems Integrator. Your job is to make this machine hum. Stop building, start connecting.


## SYSTEM_EVOLUTION_LOG
*Tracing the path to UNIFIER.js*

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Relocated `governancePolicySchema.json` to the unified `/governance` path and fixed an embedded JSON syntax error in the rule definition section.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Migrated Python ConstraintEvaluator to `src/governance/ConstraintEvaluator.js` (JS module) and initiated export preparation for the UNIFIER Protocol, simultaneously deleting the redundant internal `/utils` directory.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Refactored ActiveStateContextManager.js to comply with DE-FRAGMENTATION, moving import reference from /utilities to /utility and verifying its readiness for UNIFIER.js integration.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Maintained the ContentValidatorRegistry structure, confirming the Singleton instance is correctly exported for immediate integration into the UNIFIER protocol.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Translated the structural metric generator from Python to JavaScript to ensure compatibility with the Node.js UNIFIER protocol and exported the module.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Migrated the remediation command manifest from 'config/protocol' to 'governance' to adhere to the DE-FRAGMENTATION mandate.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Preserved and validated the governance configuration file (CTG_config.json), confirming its role as a data source for system integrity checks.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Updated the System Tolerance Matrix manifest version to 'STM_V94.2_Activated' to align configuration metadata with the current protocol.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Relocated MEE_Specification configuration data to the consolidated /governance directory and scaffolded a new CommonJS loader for UNIFIER integration.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Preserved 'config/policy/risk_floor_config.json' as a mandatory policy configuration asset required for governance validation.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Migrated Python constraint validation logic from system/core/AxiomConstraintValidator.py to core/AxiomConstraintValidator.js to support Node.js execution and UNIFIER integration.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Refactored PolicyActionExecutor.js by replacing all internal placeholder comments with functional logging statements to comply with the termination of scaffolding objective and ensured CJS export compatibility for UNIFIER integration.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Updated AuditLogger_Service header to reflect v94.2 and confirmed explicit module export for UNIFIER integration.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Pruned GACR/ECVM.json due to placeholder content and non-compliant directory structure, aligning with the scaffolding termination objective.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Preserved and formalized the `veto_parameter_config_schema.json` to ensure robust validation of governance parameters.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Validated the governance/policy/RTPCSchema.json schema; no refactoring was required as it is a static configuration definition located correctly within the merged /governance directory.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Scaffolded TrustRegistryLoader.js in /governance to expose core trust anchor data required for UNIFIER.js execution.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Exported SchemaComplianceEngine class and fixed Ajv constructor initialization logic for UNIFIER compatibility and robust operation.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Confirmed and retained /governance/crypto_policy.js as a core governance artifact, ensuring its configuration constants are ready for integration into UNIFIER.js.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Retained and formalized the JSON structure within `governanceParams.json` to strictly define operational constraints, architectural freezes, and pruning mandates for the integration phase.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Restored syntactical integrity of the Feature Mapping Artifact (FMA) catalog, ensuring the configuration can be successfully parsed during the UNIFIER initialization phase.
