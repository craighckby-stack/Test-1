# AGI-Kernel Roadmap

Implement the new model in the AGI-KERNEL and optimize it for better performance. The optimization will involve refactoring the code to reduce computational complexity, improving memory management, and enhancing the overall architecture. Additionally, implement robust error checking and exception handling mechanisms to ensure the kernel's stability and reliability.
