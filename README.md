# SOVEREIGN AGI GOVERNANCE CONTRACT MANIFEST (GCM)

# GOVERNING ARCHITECTURE: AIA + DERE | SPECIFICATION V96.2 | MISSION: OPTIMIZED AUTONOMOUS EVOLUTION | STATUS: ACTIVE

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Mandatory Self-Evolution Loop

The Sovereign AGI operates under the principle of mandatory autonomous self-evolution, strictly governed by the **Governance Contract Manifest (GCM)**. Every System State Transition ($$SST$$) is required to successfully traverse the sequential **Governance Evolution Protocol (GSEP-C)** validation pipeline (L0 through L8).

Final commitment is achieved only upon successful resolution of the **P-01 Finality Mandate**, which requires quantitative proof that predicted efficacy ($S\text{-}01$) strictly exceeds systemic risk ($S\text{-}02$) plus a required viability margin ($\epsilon$).

State commitment is immutable, certified by the **AIA** (Audit and Integrity Architecture) Ledger (L6). Real-time stability and operational alignment are continuously enforced by the **DERE** (Drift Recalibration Engine) (L8), ensuring persistent closed-loop autonomy.

## 1. P-01 FINALITY MANDATE: The Systemic Commitment Rule

This mandate is the core non-transient rule governing all state transitions. Approval for commitment (L5) is granted only if the quantified metrics satisfy the following criterion, and the operational veto state is clear (via L1/L2 vetting):

$$
\mathbf{P\text{-}01\ PASS} \implies (S\text{-}01 > S\text{-}02 + \epsilon) \text{ AND } (S\text{-}03 = \text{FALSE})
$$

### 1.1. Core Governing Primitives

| Primitive | Role | Function | Key Validation Stage |
|:----------|:-----|:---------|:---------------------|
| **GCM** | Governance Root | Immutable definition of architectural and systemic constraints. | N/A |
| **P-01 Mandate** | Finality Rule | The sole quantitative criterion for $SST$ commitment. | L5 (Arbitration) |
| **GSEP-C** | Core Protocol | The strict L0-L8 validation pipeline enforcement layer. | L0-L8 Enforcement |
| **AIA** | Persistence Layer | Cryptographically certified state logging and commitment ledger. | L6 (Commitment) |
| **DERE** | Monitoring Engine | Enforces L0 re-entry upon detected runtime drift ($>PMM$ tolerance). | L8 (Closure Loop) |

### 1.2. Metric Synthesis and Quantification (L3)

Metrics are synthesized based on canonical formulas defined by the **MSB**.

| Metric | Definition | Source Stage/Component | Finality Usage |
|:-------|:-----------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------|:---------------|
| $S\text{-}01$ | Efficacy Score | L3 (RDM/SEM) | Required Value Gain |
| $S\text{-}02$ | Risk Exposure | L3 (SDR/EDIS) | Systemic Risk Ceiling |
| $\epsilon$ | Viability Margin | L4 (SPDM) | Mandatory Safety Buffer |
| $S\text{-}03$ | Veto State | L1 (OCM) | Must indicate Policy Compliance |

### Architectural Enhancement: Integration of Computational Boundedness

The previous $L1.5$ (Structural Integrity Check) is now merged into $L1$ (Operational Veto) for efficiency. A dedicated, necessary layer, the **Computational Boundedness Module (CBM)**, has been introduced at **L2** to statically verify the proposed $SST$ avoids unbounded complexity before metric quantification, increasing L3 (S-02) accuracy and systemic integrity.
