# [SOVEREIGN AGI V94.1] DSE GOVERNANCE SPECIFICATION (GSEP-C)

---
## $\Psi$ 0. CRITICAL MANDATE: DETERMINISTIC EXECUTION GUARANTEE

The **Deterministic State Execution (DSE) Protocol** ensures verifiable and immutable system state transitions ($\Psi$). This process is strictly governed by the **Governance State Execution Pipeline - Core (GSEP-C)**. Compliance with this specification is mandatory and auditable.

### P-01 FINALITY: THE IRREVOCABLE COMMITMENT
Irrevocable state commitment (P-01 Finality) requires simultaneous, verifiable satisfaction of the three **Governance Axioms (GAX I, II, III)**. Verification constraints are sourced exclusively from the **ACVD** (`config/acvm.json`).

### RECOVERY PROTOCOL (RRP)
Operational deviation mandates an immediate **Integrity Halt (IH)**. State restoration must proceed deterministically via the **Rollback Protocol (RRP)**, secured by P-01 commitment history.

## 1. DSE COMPONENT & REFERENCE MAP

| Acronym | Definition | Role in GSEP-C Flow | Reference Config/Artifact |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| **ACVD** | Axiom Constraint Validation Domain | GAX Verification Thresholds | `config/acvm.json` |
| **CSR** | Configuration Snapshot Receipt | Input Artifact for GAX III | Input (S01) |
| **DIAL** | DSE Integrity Analyzer | Post-IH Root Cause Analysis (RCA) | Requires `config/dial_analysis_map.json` |
| **ECVM** | Execution Context Validation Map | Input Artifact for GAX II | Input (S07) |
| **GSEP-C** | Governance State Execution Pipeline - Core | Mandatory 15-Stage Flow ($\text{S00} \to \text{S14}$) | `config/gsep_c_flow.json` |
| **IH** | Integrity Halt | Immediate Operational Shutdown Trigger | N/A |
| **RRP** | Rollback Protocol | Deterministic State Reversal Procedure | `config/rrp_manifest.json` |
| **TEMM** | Transition Efficacy Measure | Input Artifact for GAX I | Input (S08) |
| **Actors** | CRoT, EMS, GAX Ex | Orchestrate GSEP-C artifact generation. | `governance/aam_definition.json` |

## 2. GSEP-C EXECUTION FLOW: ATOMIC TRANSITION SEQUENCE

GSEP-C is the atomic, non-branching 15-stage sequence defining $\Psi$ commitment. Artifacts generated by designated Actors feed directly into the P-01 Finality Verification (S11).

| Stage | Actor | Artifact Generated | Axiom Trigger | Commitment Role |
|:-----:|:---------|:---------------------:|:----------:|:---|
| **S01** | CRoT Agent | CSR (Foundational Integrity) | GAX III | Baseline Structural Audit |
| **S07** | EMS | ECVM (Runtime Compliance) | GAX II | Environment State Check |
| **S08** | EMS | TEMM (Operational Efficiency) | GAX I | Performance Threshold Check |
| **S11** | GAX Executor | P-01 Commitment | N/A | Irreversible Resolution Lock |
| **S14** | Sentinel | State Transition Receipt | N/A | Final Verification/Logging |

*Note: Stages S00, S02-S06, S09-S10, S12-S13 are operational/staging steps defined within `gsep_c_flow.json`.*

## 3. GAX VERIFICATION AND P-01 COMMITMENT

P-01 Finality is a tripartite constraint resolution against ACVD requirements. Failure to meet *any* constraint prevents transition and mandates IH.

$$ \Psi_{final} \equiv (\text{GAX I} \land \text{GAX II} \land \text{GAX III})_{\text{ACVD}} $$

| GAX ID | Policy Area | Stage Source | Input Artifact | ACVD Constraint Enforced |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **I** | Operational Efficacy | S08 | TEMM | $\Omega_{\text{min}}$ Throughput Fulfillment |
| **II** | Runtime Compliance | S07 | ECVM | Environment Boundary Integrity Check |
| **III**| Foundational Integrity | S01 | CSR | Zero Policy/Structural Violation Count |

## 4. FAILURE MANDATE: INTEGRITY HALT (IH) & RECOVERY

Execution failure is not permitted to enter an indeterminate state. IH is triggered immediately and unconditionally, leading directly into forensic analysis.

### 4.1. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (DIAL)
The **DIAL** utility executes mandatory, non-speculative RCA post-IH. DIAL requires consumption of mandatory forensic telemetry (MPAM, SGS, ADTM defined by `protocol/telemetry_spec.json`).

> **Crucial Update:** DIAL authorization to initiate RRP must conform strictly to the constraint logic defined in the **DSE Analysis Routine Map (DARM)** found at `config/dial_analysis_map.json`.

### 4.2. RRP EXECUTION
State reversal is achieved via the **Rollback Protocol (RRP)**, as deterministically prescribed by `config/rrp_manifest.json`. RRP is only authorized after DIAL certifies the required forensic snapshot integrity and confirms the RCA aligns with DARM parameters.
