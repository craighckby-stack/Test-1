# AGI-KERNAL

Cumulative Memory Core v7.1.0

## Introduction
Cumulative Memory is an experiment in the realm of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) emphasizing cumulative growth and evolutionary algorithms. The core idea revolves around the concept of "Cumulative Evolution" — enhancing the system's capabilities through continuous learning from experiences and interactions.

## System Overview
* The system utilizes a React-based frontend to visualize and interact with the AGI core.
* It relies on Firebase for user authentication and real-time data synchronization.
* GitHub APIs are used for version control and repository management.
* Cerebras API is used for large language model integration.

## Cumulative Evolution
* The system runs on a cycle-based evolution, where each cycle involves reading the current state of the repository, synthesizing new code based on the current and desired states, and committing this new code.
* The synthesis process involves querying a large language model to generate code that fulfills the system's prime directive of cumulative growth.
* Each cycle also assesses the maturity of the system, adjusting parameters for future cycles based on performance metrics.

## Safety Features
* Mass-Loss Guard: Prevents accidental truncation of the codebase by rejecting new code that is significantly smaller than the current version.

## Future Development
* Integration with Blockchain: To enable secure, decentralized, and transparent interactions with the cumulative memory core.
* Federated Learning: Implementing peer-to-peer learning to enhance the system's ability to adapt and grow without centralized data collection.
