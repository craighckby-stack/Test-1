# SOVEREIGN GOVERNANCE MANIFEST (SGM) V95.0

## GOVERNANCE METADATA & CORE DIRECTIVES

| Parameter | Value | Directive |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Protocol Version | SGM V95.0 | High-Security Iteration (V94.8 Refinement) |
| Core Mission | Deterministic System State Transition (SST) | Integrity and Predictability Assurance |
| Execution Engine | Governance State Evolution Pipeline (GSEP-C V3.5) | Auditable Control Flow Management |
| Governing Axioms | Objective Value Max. (GAX-EVAL) & Cert. Sec. (GAX-CERT) | Foundational Compliance Framework |

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: DETERMINISTIC STATE CERTIFICATION

SGM V95.0 defines the authoritative compliance pathway for all System State Transitions (SSTs). It enforces strict, ten-stage auditing via the GSEP-C V3.5 Pipeline, culminating in the cryptographic certification mandated by the Governance Axioms (GAX). The framework operates under the **Principle of Immutable Staging (Fail-Fast)**, guaranteeing immediate rollback upon any failure.

## 1.0 GOVERNANCE STATE EVOLUTION PIPELINE (GSEP-C V3.5)

This sequential enforcement mechanism guarantees deterministic, auditable governance adherence. Mandatory, high-security enforcement checkpoints are marked in **bold**.

| PRE | GSC | Schema Ingress | Assert structural integrity against the data model. | Invalid Schema Structure | N/A |
| L0 | CTM | Context Typing | Formal format and schema compliance verification. | Format Integrity Failure | N/A |
| **L1** | **PVLM** | **CRITICAL VETO** | Policy Violation Assessment (Generates S-03 signal). | **CRITICAL POLICY VIOLATION** [Ref: PVLM] | S-03 |
| **L2** | **CTAL** | **Provenance Trust** | Source authenticity, lineage, and cryptographic trust validation. | Provenance Trust Failure [Ref: DTEM] | N/A |

## 2.0 GOVERNANCE AXIOMS (GAX)

The immutable prerequisites, enforced primarily by L6 and L7, dictating SST certification. All thresholds ($\tau_{norm}, \epsilon$) are sourced from the **Core Failure Thresholds Manifest (CFTM)**.

### 2.1 GAX-EVAL: Core Objective Function (COF)

Defines the system's optimization target: maximizing normalized objective value. $S\text{-}02$ is stabilized using $\tau_{norm}$ (Normalization Factor from CFTM).

$$ \text{COF}: \max \left( \frac{S\text{-}01}{S\text{-}02 + \tau_{norm}} \right) $$

### 2.2 GAX-CERT: P-01 Finality Certification

Certification ($\mathbf{P\text{-}01\ PASS}$) requires the benefit ($S\text{-}01$) to strictly outweigh the adjusted risk ($S\text{-}02$) by the Safety Margin ($\epsilon$), alongside the absence of any critical veto signal ($S\text{-}03$).

$$ \mathbf{P\text{-}01\ PASS} \iff (S\text{-}01 > S\text{-}02 + \epsilon) \land (\neg S\text{-}03) $$

Where $\epsilon \ge \epsilon_{min}$ (Minimum Safety Margin) is sourced directly from CFTM.

## 3.0 GOVERNANCE ASSET AND CONTRACT REGISTRY (GACR)

Standardized identifiers and system dependencies critical for deterministic pipeline execution.

### 3.1 Governance Input Signals (S-Metrics)

Generated by L1 and L6, consumed primarily by L7 (VMO) and the GAX evaluation functions.

| ID | Title | Description | Type |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| S-01 | Efficacy Metric | Quantified Systemic Benefit/Value ($\ge 0$). | Numeric |
| S-02 | Risk Metric | Quantified Systemic Risk/Cost ($\ge 0$). | Numeric |
| S-03 | Veto Signal | Boolean flag indicating critical policy violation (L1 halt trigger). | Boolean |
