# AGI Evolution Roadmap

# Long-term Roadmap
## Immediate Enhancement
To enhance the current kernel code, we can add a feature to support automatic constraint optimization. This can be achieved by integrating an optimization algorithm that analyzes the constraints and suggests improvements.
## Future Development
### Core Improvements
1. **GAX Integration**: Enhance the existing GAX validation framework to support more advanced constraint validation techniques.
2. **Governance Module**: Develop a governance module that provides a user interface for managing policies and constraints.
3. **Optimization Engine**: Implement an optimization engine that analyzes constraints and suggests improvements.
### Extended Features
1. **Constraint Simulation**: Develop a constraint simulation module that allows users to test and analyze constraints in a sandbox environment.
2. **Policy Management**: Enhance the governance module to support policy management, including policy creation, editing, and deletion.
3. **Reporting and Analytics**: Develop a reporting and analytics module that provides insights into constraint validation results and optimization suggestions.
### Infrastructure and Security
1. **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy the kernel on a cloud infrastructure to ensure scalability and reliability.
2. **Security Audit**: Conduct regular security audits to ensure the kernel's security and integrity.
3. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can manage policies and constraints.
