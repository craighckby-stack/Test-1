# AGI-Kernel Roadmap

The repository already has a modular structure, with separate folders for different components and services. To further improve the kernel, the roadmap could involve: 1) Refactoring the code to improve performance, scalability, and maintainability, 2) Implementing more comprehensive testing and validation, 3) Improving documentation and comments, and 4) Continuously monitoring and addressing technical debt.
