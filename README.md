# Cumulative Memory Core
## Overview
This is the Cumulative Memory Core, designed to facilitate the AGI-KERNAL project's goal of achieving cumulative growth through continuous learning and self-improvement.

## Features
* **Mass-Loss Guard**: Prevents accidental code truncation by ensuring new code is at least 80% the size of the old code.
* **Integrity Guard**: Enables code truncation protection and prioritizes logic stack accumulation.
* **Evolution Velocity**: Displays the current cycle and stability percentage.

## Roadmap
* Implement additional safety features to prevent data corruption and ensure the integrity of the cumulative memory.
* Integrate with other decentralized technologies to enhance the project's capabilities.
