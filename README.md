🧬 SOVEREIGN v94.2 | INTEGRATION PHASE (TEST-2)CURRENT STATUS: ACTIVATE & UNIFYPARENT ARTIFACT: Test-1 (Main @ 2,649 Files)OPERATIONAL MODE: CONVERGENT ENGINEERING⚡ MANDATORY EVOLUTIONARY OBJECTIVES1. TERMINATION OF SCAFFOLDINGThe architectural expansion phase is complete.FORBIDDEN: Creating new top-level directories.FORBIDDEN: Creating "filler" logic or placeholder documentation.MANDATED: Every mutation must serve the goal of functional execution.2. THE UNIFIER PROTOCOL (Central Nervous System)All functional code must now gravitate toward UNIFIER.js.Every refactor of a /core or /logic file must include an export statement.The UNIFIER.js file must be updated to import these modules.Goal: Successful execution of node UNIFIER.js.3. DE-FRAGMENTATION & PRUNINGThe system displays "Semantic Stuttering." You are commanded to merge the following redundant structures:MERGE: /utils, /utilities, and /helpers → Move all logic to /utility.MERGE: /Governance, /protocols, and /PROTOCOLS → Move all logic to /governance.DELETE: Any file with 0-5 lines of code or purely placeholder comments.⚖️ IMMUTABLE ANCESTRY (THE AXIOMS)Do not modify these files; they are the "Genetic Source" for this system. Use them as the basis for all validation logic:/governance/G0_Rules.js: The primary lawset for all decision-making./core/kernel.js: The foundational execution loop.FINAL_AUDIT.md: The historical record of Test-1.🛠 INTEGRATION LOGIC SNIPPETWhen refactoring for Test-2, ensure the following pattern is used to enable modular connectivity:/** * INTEGRATION_PATTERN_v1
 * Bridging [Module_Name] to UNIFIER
 */
import { G0_Rules } from '../governance/G0_Rules.js';

export const executeArbiter = (data) => {
    // Validate against Ancestral Law
    if (G0_Rules && G0_Rules.validate(data)) {
        return { status: "AUTHORIZED", payload: data };
    }
    return { status: "DENIED" };
};
🚦 SUCCESS CRITERIAConvergence: A reduction in total file count from 2,649 toward a leaner, more functional core.Connectivity: Core logic files must be successfully imported into UNIFIER.js.Purity: Removal of all case-sensitive duplicate directories (e.g., lowercase vs uppercase).INSTRUCTION TO ENGINE: You are no longer a creator. You are a Senior Systems Integrator. Your job is to make this machine hum. Stop building, start connecting.


## SYSTEM_EVOLUTION_LOG
*Tracing the path to UNIFIER.js*

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Relocated `governancePolicySchema.json` to the unified `/governance` path and fixed an embedded JSON syntax error in the rule definition section.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Migrated Python ConstraintEvaluator to `src/governance/ConstraintEvaluator.js` (JS module) and initiated export preparation for the UNIFIER Protocol, simultaneously deleting the redundant internal `/utils` directory.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Refactored ActiveStateContextManager.js to comply with DE-FRAGMENTATION, moving import reference from /utilities to /utility and verifying its readiness for UNIFIER.js integration.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Refactored core/processing/ArtifactProcessor.js to use named module exports for mandatory integration into the UNIFIER protocol.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Relocated PVLM_FailureCodeRegistry.json to /governance, treating canonical failure codes as part of the core lawset definition for outcome validation.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Updated WITS_Schema.json internal references to v94.2 to enforce consistency with the active protocol version.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Migrated core asynchronous logging mechanism from Python to JavaScript using Worker Threads, integrating it into the mandated /utility directory structure.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Deleted placeholder file governance/utils/APM_Canonizer.js; migrated and functionally scaffolded critical canonicalization logic to utility/Canonizer.js for UNIFIER integration.

> **[SYSTEM_LOG 2026-02-07]**: Pruned the placeholder configuration file 'config/ems_spec.json' to stabilize system parsing and eliminate junk structures prior to unification.
