## Overview

AGI-KERNAL is an AI-powered cumulative memory architecture designed to facilitate knowledge accumulation and sharing across multiple domains.

## Integration

Our integration strategy involves the following components:

* **Blockchain:** Polygon
* **AI:** Transformers (llama-3.3-70b) with LlamaTokenizer

## Federated Learning

We employ a decentralized federated learning approach with the following configuration:

* **Peers:** 15
* **Shared Model:** GlobalModel

## Roadmap

Our roadmap includes the following milestones:

* **v6.5.0:** Improved cumulative memory architecture and enhanced integration with Polygon blockchain
* **v6.6.0:** Expanded federated learning capabilities and increased peer count
