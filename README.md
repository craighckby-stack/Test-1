# SOVEREIGN AGI V94.1: IMMUTABLE GOVERNANCE CHARTER (AOC)

## CHARTER MANDATE: Autonomous Code Evolution Governance

This document defines the **Autonomous Operational Contract (AOC)**, establishing the mandatory protocols for all System State Transitions (SSTs) and self-modification events via the **Governance Evolution Protocol (GSEP)**. The core mandate is to uphold the **Atomic Immutable Architecture (AIA)** integrity through controlled, cryptographically auditable evolution.

***

## 1. CORE GOVERNANCE REGISTRY (GCR Index)

This index defines the essential systems and contracts, rigorously enforced by the Governance Constraint Orchestrator (GCO). (Note: Specific operational subsystem definitions, such as RSAM/ATM/IDSM, are detailed in the `architecture/COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md` file.)

| Acronym | Functional Definition | Critical Role in System Integrity |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **AIA** | Atomic Immutable Architecture | Foundational layer, modifiable only via successful L5 commitment. |
| **AOC** | Autonomous Operational Contract | This overarching governance charter and its enforced ruleset. |
| **GCO** | Governance Constraint Orchestrator | Primary SST manager, P-01 arbitration agent, and invariant sequencer. |
| **GSEP** | Governance Evolution Protocol | The mandatory sequential L0-L6 modification pathway. |
| **SBC** | System Boundary Contract | Mandatory L0 input filter defining scope and permitted mutation paths. |
| **SCR** | Schema and Configuration Registry | Centralized source for structural constraints and configuration parameters. |
| **GFRM** | Governance Feedback and Remediation Module | Handles immediate autonomous structural correction upon GSEP failure (L1, L4). |
| **L4** | Adjudication Layer | The singular, irreversible commitment gateway managed by GCO. |
| **P-01** | Primary Authorization Condition | The mathematical criterion required for modification approval at L4. |

## 2. ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES & GOVERNANCE INVARIANTS

The GCO rigorously enforces the following mandatory invariants across all System State Transitions (SSTs):

### 2.1. Inviolable Protocol Integrity

1.  **GSEP Flow Integrity:** Mandatory sequential sequencing (L0 → L6) is inviolable. Any non-linear progression or detected failure (\(\text{FAIL}_{N-1}\)) triggers immediate diagnostic routing to the GFRM.
2.  **SBC Validation:** All proposed SSTs must achieve strict L0 validation against the pre-defined SBC scope and mutation path constraints.

### 2.2. Core Systemic Requirements

*   **Artifact Provenance:** All evolutionary artifacts must strictly comply with the Artifact Structural Definition Model (ASDM) and maintain verifiable lineage, confirmed by the Artifact Chain Manager (ACM).
*   **L4 Commitment Rule:** The Decisional State Checkpoint (DSC-V1) generated at L4 is the *sole*, irreversible commitment gateway for entry into the AIA Ledger. This step is non-negotiable.

## 3. GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION PROTOCOL (GSEP V94.1: L0-L6)

GSEP defines the mandatory, seven-step, traceable, forward-only pathway. Progression requires successful verification of the cryptographic output lock (\(\mathcal{L}_{N}\)) generated by the preceding stage.

| Step | Stage Name | Operational Function | Mandatory Gateway Check | Output Artifact (Lock \(\mathcal{L}_{N}\)) | Primary Constraint Agent |
|:----:|:-----------|:--------------------|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| **L0** | Initialization | Input Filtering & Scope Definition | SBC Scope Validation + SCR Load | Context Frame Manifest (C-FRAME-V1) | SCR, SBC |
| **L1** | Vetting | Policy Compliance Assessment | Policy Veto Check (\(\mathcal{S-03} = \text{FALSE}\)) | Policy Definition Block (PDB-V1) | GFRM (Veto Path) |
| **L2** | Hardening | Security & Integrity Verification | Integrity Provenance Check (ACM Verification) | Security Verified Payload (SVP-V1) | ACM |
| **L3** | Proving | Efficacy Modeling & Projection | Efficacy Projection Check (\(\mathcal{S-01} \uparrow \text{Threshold}\)) | Proof Manifest Hash (PMH-V1) | SDR |
| **L4** | **ADJUDICATION** | **Irreversible Commitment** | **P-01 PASS Condition** | **Decisional State Checkpoint (DSC-V1)** | **GCO** |
| **L5** | Commitment | AIA Ledger Finalization | Irreversible Version Lock \(\mathcal{V}_{N}\) | AIA Ledger Entry (AIA-ENTRY) | AIA Sink |
| **L6** | Execution | Operational Activation & Monitoring | D-02 Monitoring & Activation | Traceability Report (TR-V1) | Execution Vetting (RETV) |

## 4. L4 DECISIONAL ARBITRATION: P-01 CALCULUS

This section defines the mandatory, mathematically quantified condition (P-01) for modification authorization.

### 4.1. P-01 AUTHORIZATION FORMULA

**P-01 PASS** requires validation that synthesized Efficacy exceeds synthesized Risk, conditional on the absence of policy veto, using parameters derived from the SDR and SCR:

$$ 
\text{P-01 PASS} \iff ( \mathcal{S-01}_{\text{Efficacy}} > \mathcal{S-02}_{\text{Risk}} ) \land ( \mathcal{S-03}_{\text{Veto}} = \text{FALSE} ) 
$$

### 4.2. Metric Definitions & Optimization Goals

| ID | Metric Title | Purpose | Optimization Goal | Constraint Dependency |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| \(\mathcal{S-01}\) | Efficacy Projection (Trust) | Measures projected positive utility. | Maximization (\(\uparrow\) Efficacy) | Requires System Diagnostic & Reporting (SDR) |
| \(\mathcal{S-02}\) | Risk Synthesis (Floor) | Measures quantified structural/operational hazard. | Minimization (\(\downarrow\) Exposure) | Requires Hazard Modeling Data |
| \(\mathcal{S-03}\) | Compliance State (Veto) | Binary check against mandatory governance policies. | Mandatory FALSE Veto | Strict Policy Ruleset (AOC/SBC) |

### 4.3. Remediation Loop

Failure at L1 (Policy Veto) or L4 (P-01 Denial) immediately triggers remediation, routing all state context to the GFRM for structural correction and safe re-queueing, strictly bypassing all subsequent GSEP stages.
