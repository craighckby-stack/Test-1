# AOC V99.1: CORE GOVERNANCE MANIFEST & EVOLUTION PROTOCOL

This document defines the **Autonomous Operational Contract (AOC V99.1)**, which establishes the immutable governance architecture and the mandated 7-Stage Evolution Protocol (GSEP). All irreversible state transitions (**M-02 Mutation Payloads**) are strictly enforced by the **Governance Constraint Orchestrator (GCO)** and committed via the **Atomic Immutable Architecture (AIA)**.

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & SCOPE

Systemic evolution is a guarded process governed solely by the Adjudication Calculus (P-01). P-01 ensures that the projected efficacy (Trust Score, S-01) always exceeds the Maximum Risk Floor (S-02) while guaranteeing the absence of any hard Policy Veto (S-03).

---

## I. CORE GOVERNANCE: P-01 ADJUDICATION CALCULUS

Evolution is conditionally permitted solely based on a rigorous three-part constraint check at **EPDP C** (Evolution Protocol Decision Point C). The Adjudication Calculus is the final constraint gate before commitment.

$$\text{P-01 PASS} \iff ( \text{S-01}_{\text{Trust}} > \text{S-02}_{\text{Risk}} ) \land ( \text{S-03}_{\text{Veto}} = \text{FALSE} )$$ 

| Metric ID | Functional Component | Constraint Focus | Definition / Source Components |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **S-01** | ATM (AGI Trust Metrics) | **Trust Score** (Efficacy Projection) | Must strictly exceed S-02. Calculated from validated performance models (Post-PSR Traces). |
| **S-02** | MCRA Engine (Risk Arbitrator) | **Maximum Risk Floor** (Dynamic) | Synthesized from RACM, CEE inputs, PSR simulations, and real-time **ECR** data. |
| **S-03** | C-15 Policy Engine | **Policy Veto Flag** (Boolean) | Must be definitively `FALSE`. Vetting enforced via RSAM compliance rules. |

## II. EVOLUTION PROTOCOL (GSEP V99.1) & GCO ORCHESTRATION

The GSEP defines the 7-Stage atomic, integrity-locked pathway, strictly orchestrated by the GCO, leading from M-01 Intent through irreversible AIA Commitment (Stage 5).

| Stage # | Pillar Focus | Action Mandate / Lock Artifact | Critical Decision Point (EPDP) | Primary Arbiters |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **0** | Validation Root | Self-Verify AOC Governance Source (GSH Lock). Integrity Check. | EPDP Root (Initialization) | AOC Bootstrap Manifest |
| **1** | Policy Vetting | Attest M-01 intent against RSAM constraints. | **EPDP A**: Policy Compliance Pass? | RSAM, C-15 Policy Engine |
| **2** | Integrity Lock | Verify M-02 integrity using **PSIM** and RACM constraints. | N/A (Preparation Lock) | RACM, PSIM (Integrity Sub-system) |
| **3** | Runtime Proofing | Execute rigorous sandbox simulation (PSR) to generate S-01 metrics (PMH Locked). | **EPDP B**: Simulation Efficacy Pass? | PSR, ATM |
| **4** | **Adjudication** | Execute P-01 Calculus using ECR input (S-01 > S-02 & S-03=F). Final Gate Check. | **EPDP C**: P-01 Adjudication Pass? (DSCM Locked) | GCO, MCRA, ECR |
| **5** | AIA Commitment | MCR executes irreversible cryptographic Version-Lock and D-01 logging. Commitment mandated if P-01 PASS. | N/A (Terminal Commitment) | MCR, AIA Ledger |
| **6** | Audit & Stability | Secure activation (C-04), D-02/D-03 monitoring, and continuous efficacy data collection (PDFS). | N/A | DIM, Activation Manifest |
