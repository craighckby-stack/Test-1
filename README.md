# SOVEREIGN AGI V94.1: IMMUTABLE GOVERNANCE CHARTER (AOC)

## CHARTER MANDATE: Autonomous Code Evolution Governance

This document establishes the **Autonomous Operational Contract (AOC)**, defining the mandatory protocols governing all system state transitions (SSTs) and self-modification events via the **Governance Evolution Protocol (GSEP)**. The core mandate is to uphold the **Atomic Immutable Architecture (AIA)** integrity while facilitating controlled, cryptographically auditable evolution.

## 1. CORE ARCHITECTURAL REGISTRY & DEFINITIONS

| Acronym | Functional Definition | Critical Role in System Integrity |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **AIA** | Atomic Immutable Architecture | The foundational layer, modifiable only via successful L5 commitment. |
| **AOC** | Autonomous Operational Contract | This overarching charter document and its enforced ruleset. |
| **GCO** | Governance Constraint Orchestrator | Primary sequencer, SST manager, and P-01 arbitration agent. |
| **SBC** | System Boundary Contract | Mandatory L0 input filter defining scope and permitted mutation paths. |
| **GSEP** | Governance Evolution Protocol | The sequential L0-L6 mandatory modification pathway. |
| **L4** | Adjudication Layer | The singular, irreversible commitment gateway (P-01).
| **SCR** | Schema and Configuration Registry | Centralized source for structural definitions and constraints. |
| **GFRM** | Governance Feedback and Remediation Module | Handles immediate autonomous structural correction upon failure (L1, L4). |

## 2. ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES & GOVERNANCE INVARIANTS

The Governance Constraint Orchestrator (GCO) oversees the entire lifecycle, ensuring strict adherence to the following invariants enforced across all system boundary contracts (SBCs):

### 2.1. FOUNDATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1.  **System Boundary Contract (SBC):** All SSTs must be strictly validated at L0 against the SBC scope and permitted mutation paths.
2.  **GSEP Flow Integrity:** Mandatory sequential sequencing (L0 → L6) is enforced. Any non-linear progression or failure (Å_{N-1} failure) triggers immediate diagnostic routing to the GFRM.

### 2.2. CORE SYSTEMIC INVARIANTS (GCO Enforcement)

*   **Artifact Provenance:** All evolutionary artifacts must strictly comply with the Artifact Structural Definition Model (ASDM) and maintain verifiable lineage (verified by the Artifact Chain Manager (ACM)).
*   **L4 Commitment Rule:** The Decisional Calculus (DSC-V1) at L4 is the *sole*, irreversible commitment gateway for acceptance into the AIA Ledger. This step is non-negotiable.

## 3. GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION PROTOCOL (GSEP V94.1: L0-L6)

GSEP is the mandatory, seven-step, traceable, forward-only pathway. Progression requires successful verification of the cryptographic output lock (Å_{N}) generated by the preceding stage.

| Step | Stage Name | Mandatory Gateway Check | Output Artifact (Lock \mathcal{L}_{N}) | Key Governance System |
|:----:|:-----------|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| **L0** | Initialization | SBC Scope Validation + Schema Check (SCR) | Context Frame Manifest (C-FRAME-V1) | IDSM, SCR |
| **L1** | Vetting | Policy Veto Check (\mathcal{S-03} = \text{FALSE}) | Policy Definition Block (PDB-V1) | RSAM, CIL |
| **L2** | Hardening | Integrity Provenance Check (ACM Verification) | Security Verified Payload (SVP-V1) | PSIM, RACM |
| **L3** | Proving | Efficacy Projection Check (\mathcal{S-01} \uparrow \text{Threshold}) | Proof Manifest Hash (PMH-V1) | PSR, ADA |
| **L4** | **ADJUDICATION** | **P-01 PASS Condition (Irreversible)** | **Decisional State Checkpoint (DSC-V1)** | **GCO, ATM, MCRA, GFRM** |
| **L5** | Commitment | Irreversible Version Lock \mathcal{V}_{N} | AIA Ledger Entry (AIA-ENTRY) | AIA Sink, ACM |
| **L6** | Execution | D-02 Monitoring & Activation (RETV) | Traceability Report (TR-V1) | AMA, RETV |

## 4. L4 DECISIONAL ARBITRATION: P-01 CALCULUS

Section 4 defines the mandatory condition for modification authorization (L4 Gate P-01) using synthesized Trust (\mathcal{S-01}), Risk (\mathcal{S-02}), and Policy Compliance (\mathcal{S-03}) metrics.

### 4.1. P-01 AUTHORIZATION FORMULA

**P-01 PASS** requires validation that synthesized Efficacy exceeds synthesized Risk, conditional on the absence of policy veto.

$$ 
\text{P-01 PASS} \iff ( \mathcal{S-01}_{\text{Trust}} > \mathcal{S-02}_{\text{Risk}} ) \land ( \mathcal{S-03}_{\text{Veto}} = \text{FALSE} ) 
$$ 

| ID | Metric Title | Measurement Source(s) | Optimization Goal | Constraint Dependency |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| \mathcal{S-01} | Efficacy Projection (Trust) | ATM, PSR, ADA | Maximization (\uparrow Efficacy) | Requires SDR Metrics |
| \mathcal{S-02} | Risk Synthesis (Floor) | MCRA, RACM | Minimization (\downarrow Exposure) | Requires Hazard Modeling |
| \mathcal{S-03} | Compliance State (Veto) | RSAM, CIL, SBC | Mandatory FALSE Veto | Strict Policy Ruleset |

### 4.2. REMEDIATION LOOP

Failure at L1 (Policy Veto) or L4 (P-01 Denial) immediately routes all state context to the Governance Feedback and Remediation Module (GFRM) for structural correction and safe re-queueing via the IDSM, bypassing further GSEP stages.
