# SOVEREIGN ARCHITECTURAL GOVERNANCE (SAG) SPECIFICATION V99.2 (Unified Finality Kernel)

## 1.0 ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATIONS

The Sovereign Architectural Governance (SAG) system operates under the principle of **Deterministic State Evolution (DSE)** ($\\Psi_{N} \to \Psi_{N+1}$). All state transitions must be verified against the immutable **Config State Root (CSR)** and achieve atomic consensus via the **P-01 Finalization Calculus**.

### 1.1 Core Protocols & Definitions

| Acronym | Definition | Type | Governing Agent(s) | Role Summary |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **DSE** | Deterministic State Evolution | Protocol | CRoT/SGS | Mandatory $\\Psi_{N} \to \Psi_{N+1}$ transition framework. |
| **P-01** | Atomic State Finalization Calculus (S11) | Gate/Calculus | GAX | The single, immutable state consensus checkpoint. |
| **CSR** | Config State Root | Artifact (Input) | CGR (Utility) | Immutable Baseline Hash anchoring all DSE cycles (Pre-S00). |
| **TEDS** | Trusted Event Data Stream | Protocol | CRoT | Non-mutable, time-series structure for all audit trails. |
| **IH / RRP** | Integrity Halt / Rollback Protocol | Protocol | GAX/SGS | Mandatory remediation procedures upon constraint violation. |

## 2.0 AGENT ARCHITECTURE & SEPARATION OF DUTIES (SoD)

Three non-overlapping agents fulfill distinct responsibilities necessary for P-01 finality:

| Agent | Core Function Block | P-01 Critical Artifact Inputs | P-01 Final Artifact Outputs |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
| **CRoT** (Root of Trust) | Trust Anchoring & Cryptographic Finality. | Verified CSR Hash, P-01 Result. | **FMR** (Finality Metric Registry), Final State Commit Signatures. |
| **GAX** (Axiomatic Governance) | Policy Enforcement & Atomic Constraint Validation. | **ACVD**, **FASV**, ECVM, TEMM, Failure Scalars. | P-01 Calculation Result, Failure Scalars (**PVLM, MPAM, ADTM**). |
| **SGS** (State & Execution Gateway) | Execution Management & Metric Compilation. | State Delta, Operational Logs. | **ASM** (Axiomatic State Manifest), **TEMM**, **ECVM**. |

---

## 3.0 ARTIFACT TAXONOMY (IAT)

Artifacts are classified by their relationship to the CSR and their mutability during the DSE lifecycle.

### 3.1 Tier 1: Immutable Governance Baseline (Generated by CGR Utility)

These artifacts define the operational state space and are hashed prior to S00 to form the CSR.

| Acronym | Definition | Origin Agent | P-01 Function Hook |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
| **ACVD** | Axiomatic Constraint Vector Definition | GAX | Defines objective functions (e.g., UFRM, CFTM) and P-01 validation logic. |
| **FASV** | Final Axiomatic State Validation Schema | GAX | Mandated structural schema for the output **ASM**. |

### 3.2 Tier 2: Volatile Execution Manifests (High Mutability)

Accumulated data (P3/P4) utilized as inputs for the P-01 calculus.

| Acronym | Definition | Origin Agent | P-01 Axiom Reference |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
| **ASM** | Axiomatic State Manifest | SGS | Canonical full state data package for validation (Must conform to FASV). |
| **TEMM** | Total Evolved Metric Maximization | SGS | UMA I (Utility Metric) - Core outcome score relative to ACVD thresholds. |
| **ECVM** | Context Verification Metric | SGS | CA II (Context Boolean) - Verifiable runtime status check (True/False). |

### 3.3 Tier 3: Axiomatic Integrity (AI III) Failure Scalars

Ephemeral boolean flags consumed by GAX during S11. If *any* are true, Axiom III fails, resulting in a mandatory IH/RRP procedure capture via TEDS.

| Acronym | Definition | Stage Set | Failure Trigger |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
| **PVLM** | Pre-Validation Logic Miss | P2 (S02-S04) | Failure in early constraint checks. |
| **MPAM** | Manifest Policy Adherence Misalignment | P2 (S02-S04) | **ASM** structural deviation from **FASV** definition. |
| **ADTM** | Axiomatic Deviation Trigger Metric | P4 (S08-S10) | Policy boundary violation during **TEMM** calculation. |

---

## 4.0 P-01 FINALITY KERNEL: ATOMIC VALIDATION (S11)

Validation is achieved only through simultaneous satisfaction of all three independent Axioms defined in the ACVD. A single failure mandates IH or RRP activation.

$$\text{P-01 PASS} \iff (\text{UMA I}) \land (\text{CA II}) \land (\text{AI III})$$

| Axiom ID | Name | Constraint Definition (ACVD Logic) | Required Status |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
| **I (UMA)** | Utility Maximization | $\text{TEMM} \ge \text{UFRM} + \text{CFTM}$ | Generated utility metric meets the dynamically defined policy floor. |
| **II (CA)** | Context Attestation | $\text{ECVM} = \text{True}$ | The underlying execution environment maintains verifiable integrity. |
| **III (AI)** | Axiomatic Integrity | $\neg (\text{PVLM} \lor \text{MPAM} \lor \text{ADTM})$ | All mandatory integrity failure flags must be explicitly False. |
