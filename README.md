# AGI-KERNAL

AGI-KERNAL is a cumulative memory system designed to grow and adapt over time. The system is built on top of a React application and utilizes Firebase for authentication and data storage.

## Features

* Cumulative memory: The system has the ability to grow and adapt over time, adding new features and optimizations while preserving existing functionality.
* Safety guard: The system includes a mass-loss guard that prevents accidental truncation of the codebase.
* Evolution velocity: The system tracks its own evolution velocity, providing insights into its growth and stability.

## Technical Details

* The system utilizes a React application with Firebase authentication and data storage.
* The system uses a custom scrollbar and includes a number of other UI components.

## Future Development

* The system will continue to evolve and adapt over time, adding new features and optimizations while preserving existing functionality.
* The system will be refined and improved, with a focus on stability and performance.
