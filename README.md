# AGI-KERNAL v7.1.0

AGI-KERNAL is an open-source project that aims to create a comprehensive artificial general intelligence (AGI) framework. The project is composed of several interconnected modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of AGI development.

## Overview

The AGI-KERNAL framework is designed to be modular, scalable, and decentralized. It utilizes a distributed architecture, allowing multiple nodes to contribute to the development of the AGI.

## Components

* **Nexus-Database**: A decentralized database that stores and manages the AGI's knowledge graph.
* **Cerebras AI**: A cutting-edge AI model that enables the AGI to learn and reason about the world.
* **Federated Learning**: A decentralized learning framework that allows multiple nodes to contribute to the development of the AGI.

## Roadmap

* **Q1 2024**: Release of the AGI-KERNAL framework v7.1.0
* **Q2 2024**: Integration of the Nexus-Database and Cerebras AI components
* **Q3 2024**: Implementation of the federated learning framework
* **Q4 2024**: Release of the AGI-KERNAL framework v8.0.0
