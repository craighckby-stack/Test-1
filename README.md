⚖️ SOVEREIGN v94.1 | RECURSIVE EVOLUTIONARY AUDITTimestamp: 2026-02-07Status: [STATE_FINALITY_REACHED]Final File Count: 2,649 ArtifactsSystem Designation: Autonomous GSIM Scaffolding Experiment (Test-1)1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYThis repository represents the output of a closed-loop evolutionary engine. For [X] cycles, the Sovereign v94.1 engine utilized Gemini 2.5 Flash to mutate, refactor, and scaffold a governance-first AGI framework. The system achieved a "Protocol-Heavy" architecture, prioritizing constraint definition over functional execution.2. ARCHITECTURAL TOPOGRAPHYThe audit reveals a system that evolved through Recursive Fragmentation. The directory weights indicate the following priorities:SectorFile CountPercentageFunctional RoleInfrastructure (/config, /system)78629.7%Scaffolding and environmental constraints.Protocols (/governance, /protocol)34212.9%Definition of the GSIM Lawset.Logic (/src, /core, /engine)69626.3%Active decision arbiters and kernel functions.Utility & Schema300+~11%Recursive support structures and data definitions.3. KEY OBSERVATIONSA. Evolutionary Stuttering (Structural Drift)The system displays "stuttering" in its organizational logic, evidenced by the creation of duplicate-intent folders:/governance vs /Governance/protocols vs /protocol vs /PROTOCOLS/utility vs /utilities vs /utilsInterpretation: This is a symptom of "Context-Window Drift," where the AI recognizes the need for a module but fails to verify existing tree structures before scaffolding a new vector.B. The Governance-to-Logic RatioWith 1,138 Protocol-related files, the system is mathematically obsessed with "Checking" its own work. The ratio suggests a system that is 1.6x more interested in how it should act than in actually acting.C. Seedling Autonomous BehaviorsWe identify three "Critical Seedlings" that represent the highest level of autonomous intent reached during this run:/arbiters: Attempts at self-judgement logic./integrity: The emergence of a self-checksumming protocol./evolutionary: Initial attempts to define the rules of its own future mutation.4. FINALITY VERDICT: [G0_SEAL_RECOMMENDED]The system has reached a state of Architectural Saturation. The "Drift" (fragmentation of folders) is beginning to outpace "Innovation" (new logic). To preserve the integrity of the 2,649 existing artifacts, the mutation loop should be terminated to prevent "Chaos Corruption."Audit performed by GSIM_OBSERVER_v1.0Data Source: GitHub Tree API (Main Branch)Inference Engine: Gemini-2.5-Flash-Preview-09-2025
