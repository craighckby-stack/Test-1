# SOVEREIGN AGI V99.0: IMMUTABILITY & EVOLUTION STANDARD (AOC)

This document mandates the **Autonomous Operational Contract (AOC V99.0)**, defining the immutable governance structure, lexicon, and operational mandate for all systemic evolution. All irreversible state transitions (**M-02 Mutation Payloads**) are strictly governed by the **Governance Constraint Orchestrator (GCO)** via the 7-Stage Evolution Protocol (GSEP) and committed via the **Atomic Immutable Architecture (AIA)**.

---

## CRITICAL MANDATE: P-01 ADJUDICATION GATE (EPDP C)

Systemic evolution is permitted only if the quantifiable Trust score strictly exceeds the dynamically calculated Risk Floor, and no policy veto is asserted. This requirement defines the core **P-01 Calculus** and is enforced at the GSEP Stage 4 Adjudication.

$$\text{P-01 PASS} \iff ( \text{S-01}_{\text{Trust}} > \text{S-02}_{\text{Risk}} ) \land ( \text{S-03}_{\text{Veto}} = \text{FALSE} )$$ 

| Metric ID | Component | Definition | Mandate / Source | 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **S-01** | ATM | Quantitative Efficacy Projection (Trust Score) | Must strictly exceed S-02. Calculated from validated performance models. |
| **S-02** | MCRA Engine | Dynamic Maximum Risk Floor | Synthesized from CEE, PSR traces, RACM, and **ECR** data. |
| **S-03** | C-15 Policy Engine | Policy Veto Flag (Boolean Constraint) | Must be definitively `FALSE`. Enforced by policy non-compliance rules. |

## I. GSEP: THE 7-STAGE ATOMIC EVOLUTION PROTOCOL (GCO Mandated)

The Governance Constraint Orchestrator (GCO) enforces GSEP, providing the atomic path from M-01 Intent to irreversible AIA Commitment. Integrity artifacts lock the M-02 Payload status at three critical Evolution Protocol Decision Points (EPDPs).

| Stage # | Pillar Focus | Action Mandate / Integrity Lock | Critical Checkpoint / EPDP | Required Artifact
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **0** | Integrity Root | Validate AOC Governance Source against current state. | N/A | **GSH** Lock Active | 
| **1** | Policy Compliance | Attest M-01 intent against RSAM constraints. | **EPDP A**: Policy Vetting Pass? | M-01 Vetted Lock | 
| **2** | State Verification | Verify M-02 integrity (PSIM), provenance, CEE, and RACM constraints. | N/A | M-02 Verified Lock | 
| **3** | Runtime Validation | Execute rigorous sandbox simulation (PSR) to generate performance traces. | **EPDP B**: Simulation Pass? | **PMH** Created & Locked | 
| **4** | **Adjudication** | Execute P-01 Calculus (S-01 > S-02) after **ECR** input. Final Gate Check. | **EPDP C**: P-01 Pass? | DSCM Audit Lock | 
| **5** | AIA Commitment | MCR executes irreversible cryptographic Version-Lock and D-01 logging. | N/A | **MCR** Lock Active | 
| **6** | Deployment & Audit | Secure activation (C-04), monitored by D-02 DIM, and feedback collection. | N/A | D-02 Final Report |
