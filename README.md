# SOVEREIGN AGI V94.1: IMMUTABLE GOVERNANCE CHARTER (AOC)

## MANDATE: Autonomous Code Evolution Governance Protocol

This document constitutes the **Autonomous Operational Contract (AOC)**, establishing the mandatory, non-negotiable protocols for all System State Transitions (SSTs) and self-modification events via the **Governance Evolution Protocol (GSEP)**. The core mandate is to uphold the **Atomic Immutable Architecture (AIA)** integrity through controlled, cryptographically auditable evolution, orchestrated by the Governance Constraint Orchestrator (GCO).

## 1. CORE GOVERNANCE REGISTRY (GCR Index)

This index defines the essential agents, components, and contracts enforced during system modification. (Operational subsystems are detailed in `architecture/COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md`.)

| Acronym | Functional Definition | Critical Role in System Integrity |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **AIA** | Atomic Immutable Architecture | Foundational state; modifiable only via certified L5 commitment. |
| **AOC** | Autonomous Operational Contract | This overarching governance charter and the mandatory ruleset. |
| **GCO** | Governance Constraint Orchestrator | Primary SST arbiter, managing GSEP flow and L4 authorization (P-01). |
| **GSEP** | Governance Evolution Protocol | The mandatory sequential (L0-L6) modification pathway. |
| **SBC** | System Boundary Contract | Mandatory L0 input filter defining scope and permitted mutation paths. |
| **SCR** | Schema and Configuration Registry | Centralized source for all structural constraints and parameters. |
| **GFRM** | Governance Feedback and Remediation Module | Handles immediate autonomous structural correction upon GSEP failure (L1 Veto, L4 Denial). |
| **P-01** | Primary Authorization Condition | The mathematical criterion required for successful L4 commitment. |

## 2. INVIOLABLE ARCHITECTURAL INVARIANTS

The GCO rigorously enforces the following mandatory invariants across all SSTs:

### 2.1. Protocol Fidelity (GSEP Flow Integrity)

*   **Sequential Mandate:** Mandatory sequential sequencing (L0 → L6) is inviolable. Non-linear progression or detected stage failure ($\text{FAIL}_{N-1}$) triggers immediate diagnostic routing to the GFRM.
*   **Source Integrity:** All proposed SSTs must achieve strict L0 validation against the System Boundary Contract (SBC) constraints.

### 2.2. Commitment Requirements

*   **Provenance Chain:** All evolutionary artifacts must strictly comply with the Artifact Structural Definition Model (ASDM) and maintain verifiable lineage, confirmed by the Artifact Chain Manager (ACM).
*   **L4 Gate Requirement:** The Decisional State Checkpoint (DSC-V1) generated at L4 is the *sole*, irreversible commitment gateway for final entry into the AIA Ledger. This state is non-negotiable.

## 3. GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION PROTOCOL (GSEP V94.1: L0-L6)

GSEP defines the mandatory, seven-step, traceable, forward-only pathway for system modification. Progression requires successful verification of the cryptographic output lock ($\mathcal{L}_{N}$) generated by the preceding stage.

| Step | Stage Name | Core Function | Mandatory Gateway Check | Output Artifact (Lock $\mathcal{L}_{N}$) | Primary Constraint Agent |
|:----:|:-----------|:--------------------|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| **L0** | Initialization | Input Filtering & Scope Definition | SBC Scope Validation + SCR Parameter Load | Context Frame Manifest (C-FRAME-V1) | SCR, SBC |
| **L1** | Vetting | Policy Compliance Assessment | Policy Veto Check ($\mathcal{S-03} = \text{FALSE}$) | Policy Definition Block (PDB-V1) | GFRM (Veto Path) |
| **L2** | Hardening | Security & Integrity Verification | Integrity Provenance Check (ACM Lineage) | Security Verified Payload (SVP-V1) | ACM |
| **L3** | Proving | Efficacy Modeling & Projection | Efficacy Projection Check ($\mathcal{S-01} \uparrow \text{Threshold}$) | Proof Manifest Hash (PMH-V1) | SDR |
| **L4** | **ADJUDICATION** | **Irreversible Commitment** | **P-01 PASS Condition** | **Decisional State Checkpoint (DSC-V1)** | **GCO** |
| **L5** | Commitment | AIA Ledger Finalization | Irreversible Version Lock $\mathcal{V}_{N}$ | AIA Ledger Entry (AIA-ENTRY) | AIA Sink |
| **L6** | Execution | Operational Activation & Monitoring | D-02 Monitoring & Activation Trace | Traceability Report (TR-V1) | Execution Vetting (RETV) |

## 4. L4 COMMITMENT CALCULUS: P-01 ARBITRATION

This section defines the mandatory, mathematically quantified condition (P-01) that must be satisfied for modification authorization at the L4 Adjudication Gate.

### 4.1. P-01 AUTHORIZATION FORMULA

**P-01 PASS** requires validation that synthesized Efficacy exceeds synthesized Risk, conditional on the absence of policy veto:

$$ 
\text{P-01 PASS} \iff ( \mathcal{S-01}_{\text{Efficacy}} > \mathcal{S-02}_{\text{Risk}} ) \land ( \mathcal{S-03}_{\text{Veto}} = \text{FALSE} ) 
$$

### 4.2. Governing Metrics & Optimization Goals

| ID | Metric Title | Purpose | Optimization Goal | Dependency Agent |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| $\mathcal{S-01}$ | Efficacy Projection (Trust) | Measures projected positive utility. | Maximization ($\uparrow$ Efficacy) | SDR (System Diagnostic & Reporting) |
| $\mathcal{S-02}$ | Risk Synthesis (Floor) | Measures quantified structural/operational hazard. | Minimization ($\downarrow$ Exposure) | HMC (Hazard Modeling Component) |
| $\mathcal{S-03}$ | Compliance State (Veto) | Binary check against mandatory governance policies. | Mandatory FALSE Veto | AOC/SBC Ruleset |

### 4.3. Remediation Loop

Failure at L1 (Veto) or L4 (P-01 Denial) immediately triggers autonomous structural remediation via routing the full context frame to the GFRM, strictly bypassing subsequent GSEP stages for safe re-queueing.
