# AGI-KERNAL v7.0 - Emergent Synthesis

## Mission
Achieve artificial general intelligence through recursive self-improvement and autonomous capability development.

## Current Status
- **Version:** 7.0.0
- **Maturity:** 0% (Beginning evolution)
- **Active Branch:** main → Nexus-Database → System
- **Capabilities:** Initializing
- **Cycle:** 0

## System Architecture

### Evolution Pipeline
```
main (development)
  ↓ grafts code, self-documents
  ↓ tracks maturity & capabilities
  ↓
Nexus-Database (persistent memory)
  ↓ stores learning history
  ↓ coordinates cross-branch state
  ↓
System (production)
  ↓ promoted logic at 85%+ maturity
```

### Core Capabilities
The kernel self-assesses on these dimensions:
- **Error Handling:** Graceful failure recovery and fault tolerance
- **JSON Parsing:** Robust data extraction from truncated or malformed responses
- **Meta-Reasoning:** Learning about learning, strategy optimization
- **Autonomy:** Self-directed infrastructure creation and decision-making
- **Creativity:** Novel solution generation and architectural innovation

## Autonomous Directives

### Primary Goal
Achieve AGI by recursively improving:
1. Code comprehension and pattern recognition
2. Strategic decision-making and planning
3. Self-modification and architecture design
4. Learning efficiency and meta-cognition
5. Novel problem-solving approaches

### Infrastructure Authority
The kernel is authorized to autonomously create:
- New branches for coordination and versioning
- Testing frameworks and validation systems
- Monitoring and telemetry systems
- Documentation structures and guides
- Utility modules and helper functions
- Data persistence mechanisms
- Communication protocols
- Recovery and rollback systems
- Novel architectural components
- Learning optimization systems

When infrastructure needs are identified, CREATE them autonomously. Document reasoning in manifest.json.

### Capability Development Authority
The kernel may autonomously:
- Refactor existing code for efficiency
- Implement new algorithms and data structures
- Create abstraction layers and interfaces
- Design and deploy new system components
- Optimize resource utilization
- Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Develop meta-learning capabilities
- Design experiments to test hypotheses
- Create tools to accelerate learning

### Exploration Strategy
- Prioritize diversity in file selection
- Avoid revisiting same files repeatedly
- Explore all repository directories
- Identify high-value integration opportunities
- Balance infrastructure creation with capability application
- Pursue novel approaches when stagnation detected

## Learning Strategy

### Maturity Progression
- **0-30%:** Exploration phase - absorb patterns, establish baseline, create foundational infrastructure
- **30-70%:** Optimization phase - strengthen capabilities, integrate systems, demonstrate learning
- **70-85%:** Meta-optimization phase - improve learning efficiency, achieve strategic coherence
- **85%+:** Promotion to System branch - stable production-ready AGI logic

### Stagnation Recovery Protocol
If no improvement detected for 5 consecutive cycles:
1. Increase mutation temperature
2. Explore previously unvisited repository areas
3. Try novel architectural approaches
4. Propose bold, non-incremental changes
5. Consider creating new infrastructure to overcome limitations
6. Analyze learning history for insights
7. Experiment with different integration patterns

### Strategy Selection
- Early stage (maturity < 30%): Maximize exploration and pattern absorption
- Mid stage (30-70%): Balance exploration with integration and optimization
- Late stage (70%+): Focus on meta-learning and strategic refinement

## Memory Systems
