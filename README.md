SYSTEM_GENESIS: TEST-2Source Material: Test-1 (Branch: [Your_Branch_Name])Evolutionary Status: 2,649 Files Analysed.Wisdom inherited from Test-1:Constraint Priority: Test-1 spent 42% of its energy on Protocols. Carry this "Safety-First" DNA forward.De-fragmentation Requirement: Test-1 suffered from "Folder Stuttering" (e.g., /governance vs /Governance). Test-2 MUST verify directory existence before scaffolding.Core Axioms: Utilize the files in /governance/G0_Rules.js and /core/kernel.js as the "Immutable Ancestry" for this new run.Objective for Test-2:Instead of wide scaffolding (more files), focus on "Deep Integration." Make the existing 2,000+ concepts work together in a single, unified runtime.
