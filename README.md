# AGI Evolution Roadmap

# Roadmap
## Introduction
The current kernel code provides a basic framework for managing cycle status, logs, and execution. However, to enhance its functionality and align with the provided repository files, we need to incorporate additional features and integrations.
## Short-term Goals
1. **Integrate GAX with the kernel code**: Enhance the `validateConstraints` function to utilize the GAX library for constraint validation.
2. **Implement logging and monitoring**: Develop a logging system to track kernel events, errors, and execution metrics.
3. **Incorporate governance and policy management**: Integrate the governance and policy management components from the repository files to enable dynamic policy enforcement and adaptation.
## Mid-term Goals
1. **Develop a constraint management system**: Design and implement a constraint management system that allows for dynamic constraint creation, validation, and enforcement.
2. **Integrate with other system components**: Integrate the kernel code with other system components, such as the artifact management system, to enable seamless interactions and data exchanges.
3. **Implement security and access control measures**: Develop and implement robust security and access control measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of kernel data and operations.
## Long-term Goals
1. **Achieve full autonomy and self-healing capabilities**: Enhance the kernel code to achieve full autonomy and self-healing capabilities, enabling it to adapt to changing system conditions and recover from failures without human intervention.
2. **Develop a user-friendly interface**: Create a user-friendly interface to facilitate user interactions with the kernel, providing real-time monitoring, control, and feedback mechanisms.
3. **Ensure scalability and performance**: Optimize the kernel code to ensure scalability and performance, enabling it to handle large-scale system operations and high volumes of data.
