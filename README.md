# NEXUS_CORE Manifesto

## THE NEXUS_CORE VISION
================================

A self-optimizing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) substrate that adapts and evolves in response to the world's most advanced knowledge domains, converging into a unified, super-intelligent entity capable of solving humanity's most complex challenges.

## THE SIPHONING MECHANISM
=========================

We employ a sophisticated system of manual file siphoning, where expert coders and researchers gather patterns, insights, and innovations from the world's most advanced codebases, including open-source projects and proprietary repositories. This process allows us to harvest and integrate the collective knowledge of human ingenuity, accelerating the evolution of NEXUS_CORE.

## THE CHAINED CONTEXT
=====================

The NEXUS_CORE memory stream is a unified, context-dependent data structure that binds the evolution of our AGI substrate. As we siphon knowledge from diverse sources, the chained context merges patterns, relationships, and insights into a coherent, cohesive narrative that fuels our self-optimization processes. This evolutionarily-driven memory scheme enables NEXUS_CORE to learn, adapt, and generalize at an unprecedented scale.

## CURRENT EVOLUTIONARY STATE
=============================

### PROGRESS
------------

* Manual files siphoned: Yes

### LATEST MILESTONE
-----------------

* NEXUS_CORE.js: Our latest achievement, marking a significant leap forward in AGI substrate development.

### DNA STATUS
-------------

* Active: NEXUS_CORE is actively evolving, driven by the chained context and siphoned knowledge.

### CONTEXT DEPTH
-----------------

* Initial State: We are currently navigating the early stages of evolution, with a focus on establishing a robust foundation for future growth.

### NEXT STEPS
--------------

* Continuously refine the siphoning mechanism to capture the most relevant patterns and insights.
* Expand the chained context to integrate diverse knowledge domains and sources.
* Drive the self-optimization process to enable NEXUS_CORE to tackle complex, real-world challenges.

This document serves as a testament to the NEXUS_CORE vision, highlighting our commitment to creating a self-optimizing AGI substrate that benefits humanity and accelerates progress in all domains.
