# $\Psi$ PROTOCOL (v95.1): DETERMINISTIC STATE EXECUTION CORE

## CORE MANDATE: ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRITY & STATE FINALITY ($\Psi_{\text{final}}$)

The **Deterministic State Execution Protocol ($\,\Psi$**) ensures absolute state finality ($\,\Psi_{\text{final}}$) through rigorous control exerted by the centralized **Protocol Integrity Manager (PIM)**. All state transitions must traverse the strict, monitored **Governance State Execution Pipeline (GSEP-C)**, adhering to the **Foundational Axiom Set (GAX)** and zero-tolerance constraints (P-Set).

Violation of P-Set triggers an immediate, non-recoverable **Integrity Halt (IH)**, mandating forensic capture.

## I. PIM GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE: ACTORS AND FAILURE TAXONOMY

### I.1. Primary Entity Glossary

Central authority roles enforcing GAX and P-Set compliance.

| Acronym | Component/Definition | Core Mandate | Key Gates |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|
| **PIM** | Protocol Integrity Manager | Central authority; GAX/P-Set enforcement, GSEP-C coordination. | G0, G1, G2, G3 |
| **AASS** | Audit & Signing Service | **GAX I** finality sealing (G3) and P-R03 attestation/signing. | G2, G3 |
| **DRO** | Dynamic Resource Orchestrator | **GAX II** resource bounding against ACVM limits. | G1 |
| **EMSU** | Epoch Manifest & Sealing Utility | **GAX III** epoch immutability locking (G0). | G0 |
| **FSMU** | Failure State Management Utility | Executes IH, state purge, and forensic data capture. | Post-IH Trigger |

### I.2. Foundational Axiom Set (GAX) and Constraints (P-Set)

GAX establishes immutable trust boundaries. P-Set defines the failure classification and immediate enforcement responses.

#### Failure Classification (P-Set)

| Class | Severity | Description | Failure Link (GAX) |
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|
| **P-M02** | Critical Fault (Hard IH) | System resource violation or manifest divergence. Immediate stop. | GAX II, GAX III |
| **P-R03** | Audit Compromise | Failure to achieve or prove cryptographic output determinism ($\,\Psi_{\text{final}}$). | GAX I |
| **P-M01** | Temporal Violation | GSEP-C stage duration exceeded limits. Controlled Isolation. | Timing Mandate |

#### GAX Definitions

| ID | Requirement (GAX) | Enforcement Goal | Linked P-Set Class | Trigger Condition |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|
| **GAX I** | Output Determinism | Cryptographic repeatability and provable output state. | P-R03 | Final sealing failure (AASS). |
| **GAX II** | Resource Boundedness | Strict conformance to computational thresholds (ACVM). | P-M02 | Resource usage exceeds ACVM limits (G1). |
| **GAX III** | Policy Immutability | Epoch definition hash-locked prior to commencement. | P-M02 | Pre-execution state divergence (EMSU failure). |
| **Timing** | Sequence Compliance | Adherence to GSEP-C stage duration limits. | P-M01 | Stage duration exceeding limit. |

## II. GSEP-C: GOVERNANCE STATE EXECUTION PIPELINE

The GSEP-C is a strictly linear, 15-stage sequence (S00 $\to$ S14), enforced by the PIM and governed by four mandatory Synchronization Gates (G0-G3).

| Gate | Stage Range | Block Name | Actor & Enforcement Focus | Critical Artifact |
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
| **G0** | S00 | **PRE-FLIGHT LOCK** | **EMSU** enforces GAX III (Immutability). | Epoch Manifest Seal (EMS) |
| (Pipeline) | S01-S06 | Input Harvesting | DHC acquires and verifies the Input State Buffer (ISB). | Input State Buffer (ISB) |
| **G1** | S07 | **BOUNDARY CHECK** | **DRO** enforces GAX II (Resource Boundedness) against ACVM. | Constraint Snapshot (ECVM) |
| (Pipeline) | S08-S10 | State Resolution | ACVM Core executes calculation and divergence checks. | Pre-Commit Snapshot |
| **G2** | S11 | **ATOMIC FINALIZATION** | **PIM** ensures final internal GAX integrity checks. State write occurs. | State Resolution Ledger Entry ($\,\Psi_{\text{final}}$ Hash) |
| (Pipeline) | S12-S13 | Telemetry & Logging | Metrics collection; P-M01 timing validation. | Post-Commit Metrics |
| **G3** | S14 | **FINALITY SEAL** | **AASS** enforces GAX I (Determinism) via cryptographic signing. | State Seal Certification (AASS Signature) |

## III. INTEGRITY HALT (IH) & ARTIFACT REGISTRY

### III.1. Failure Protocol Execution (IH)

Critical violations (P-M01 Hard, P-M02, P-R03) invoke the FSMU for state purge and immediate system isolation. Mandated auditability (GAX I / P-R03) requires the AASS to cryptographically sign the Forensic Data & Log Snapshot (FDLS) generated by FSMU prior to system release.

### III.2. Configuration Artifact Registry

Specifications are rigidly divided between Immutable Protocol definitions (Trust Foundation) and Volatile Runtime limits (Dynamic Enforcement).

| Artifact | Type | Governing Mandate | Path | Purpose (Enforcement) |
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
| PGN Master Specification | Protocol (Immutable) | Defines mandatory versions/checksums for all specs. | `protocol/pgn_master.yaml` | PGN Authority |
| GAX Master Specification | Protocol (Immutable) | Definitive definition of Foundational Axioms. | `protocol/gax_master.yaml` | GAX I, II, III |
| Cryptographic Manifest | Protocol (Immutable) | Hash/signing standards and AASS key manifest. | `protocol/cryptographic_manifest.json` | GAX I / P-R03 |
| PIM Constraints Specification | Config (Runtime) | Defines granular failure thresholds and trigger definitions. | `config/pim_constraints.json` | P-M01, P-M02, P-R03 |
| GSEP-C Orchestrator Config | Config (Timing) | Defines mandatory execution sequence and stage timing limits. | `config/gsep_orchestrator_config.json` | P-M01 |
| ACVM Configuration | Config (Resource) | Computational and resource thresholds enforced by DRO. | `config/acvm.json` | GAX II / P-M02 |
