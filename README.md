# SOVEREIGN AGI V94.1: IMMUTABLE GOVERNANCE CHARTER (AOC)

## ABSTRACT: Autonomous Code Evolution Governance

This document establishes the Autonomous Operational Contract (AOC), defining the mandatory protocols governing all system state transitions (SSTs) and self-modification events via the Governance Evolution Protocol (GSEP). The core mandate is to uphold the Atomic Immutable Architecture (AIA) integrity while facilitating controlled, auditable evolution.

## 1. ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES & COMPLIANCE

The Governance Constraint Orchestrator (GCO) oversees the entire lifecycle, ensuring strict compliance with fundamental governance invariants.

### 1.1. FOUNDATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1.  **System Boundary Contract (SBC):** All SSTs must originate from and be strictly contained by the SBC scope, acting as the L0 input gate and defining permitted mutation paths.
2.  **Governance Evolution Protocol (GSEP):** Mandatory, strictly sequential passage (L0 → L6) is enforced, secured by cryptographic output locking at each stage.

### 1.2. CORE SYSTEMIC INVARIANTS (GCO Enforcement)

The GCO rigorously enforces system integrity via the following constraints:

*   **GSEP Flow Integrity:** Mandatory sequential sequencing (L0 → L6). Any break in the sequence chain (\mathcal{L}_{N-1} failure) triggers immediate termination and diagnostic routing to the Governance Feedback and Remediation Module (GFRM).
*   **Artifact Provenance:** All evolutionary artifacts must strictly comply with the Artifact Structural Definition Model (ASDM) and maintain verifiable lineage (verified by the Artifact Chain Manager (ACM)).
*   **L4 Commitment Rule:** The Decisional Calculus (DSC-V1) at L4 is the *sole*, irreversible commitment gateway for acceptance into the AIA Ledger.

## 2. GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION PROTOCOL (GSEP V94.1: L0-L6)

GSEP is the seven-step, traceable, forward-only pathway. Progression requires successful verification of the cryptographic output lock (\mathcal{L}_{N}) generated by the preceding stage.

| Step | Stage Name | Mandatory Gateway Check | Output Artifact (Lock \mathcal{L}_{N}) | Key Governance System |
|:----:|:-----------|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| **L0** | Initialization | SBC Scope Validation + Schema Check (SCR) | Context Frame Manifest (C-FRAME-V1) | IDSM, SCR |
| **L1** | Vetting | Policy Veto Check (\mathcal{S-03} = \text{FALSE}) | Policy Definition Block (PDB-V1) | RSAM, CIL |
| **L2** | Hardening | Integrity Provenance Check (ACM Verification) | Security Verified Payload (SVP-V1) | PSIM, RACM |
| **L3** | Proving | Efficacy Projection Check (\mathcal{S-01} \uparrow \text{Threshold}) | Proof Manifest Hash (PMH-V1) | PSR, ADA |
| **L4** | **Adjudication** | **P-01 PASS Condition (Irreversible)** | **Decisional State Checkpoint (DSC-V1)** | GCO, ATM, MCRA, GFRM |
| **L5** | Commitment | Irreversible Version Lock \mathcal{V}_{N} | AIA Ledger Entry (AIA-ENTRY) | AIA Sink, ACM |
| **L6** | Execution | D-02 Monitoring & Activation (RETV) | Traceability Report (TR-V1) | AMA, RETV |

## 3. L4 DECISIONAL ARBITRATION: P-01 CALCULUS

Section 3 defines the mandatory condition for modification authorization (L4 Gate P-01) and the source metrics used by the GCO.

### 3.1. P-01 Authorization Formula

P-01 requires dynamic synthesis of Trust (\mathcal{S-01}), Risk (\mathcal{S-02}), and policy Compliance (\mathcal{S-03}) values sourced from the SCR and various predictive modules.

$$ 
\text{P-01 PASS} \iff ( \mathcal{S-01}_{\text{Trust}} > \mathcal{S-02}_{\text{Risk}} ) \land ( \mathcal{S-03}_{\text{Veto}} = \text{FALSE} ) 
$$ 

| ID | Metric Title | Measurement Source(s) | Optimization Goal | Dependence Constraint |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| \mathcal{S-01} | Efficacy Projection (Trust) | ATM, PSR, ADA | Maximization (\uparrow Efficacy) | SDR Metrics Required |
| \mathcal{S-02} | Risk Synthesis (Floor) | MCRA, RACM | Minimization (\downarrow Exposure) | Hazard Model Inputs |
| \mathcal{S-03} | Compliance State (Veto) | RSAM, CIL, SBC | Mandatory FALSE Veto | Policy Ruleset Strict |

### 3.2. Remediation and Feedback Loop

Failure at L1 (Policy Veto) or L4 (P-01 Denial) initiates immediate feedback routing to the Governance Feedback and Remediation Module (GFRM) for autonomous structural correction and safe re-queueing via the Input Decision State Manager (IDSM).
