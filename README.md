# SOVEREIGN AGI V99.0: GOVERNANCE & EVOLUTION STANDARD (AOC)

This document defines the **Autonomous Operational Contract (AOC V99.0)**, establishing the immutable governance structure and operational mandate for all systemic evolution. All irreversible state transitions (**M-02 Mutation Payloads**) are strictly governed by the **Governance Constraint Orchestrator (GCO)** through the 7-Stage Evolution Protocol (GSEP) and committed via the **Atomic Immutable Architecture (AIA)**.

---

## CRITICAL MANDATE: P-01 ADJUDICATION (GSEP Stage 4)

Evolution is conditionally permitted based on the outcome of the P-01 Calculus, which evaluates Trust versus Risk and ensures Policy Veto absence. This calculus is enforced at **EPDP C** (Evolution Protocol Decision Point C).

$$\text{P-01 PASS} \iff ( \text{S-01}_{\text{Trust}} > \text{S-02}_{\text{Risk}} ) \land ( \text{S-03}_{\text{Veto}} = \text{FALSE} )$$ 

| Metric ID | Functional Component | Definition | Mandate / Constraint Focus |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **S-01** | ATM | Quantitative Efficacy Projection (Trust Score) | Must strictly exceed S-02. Calculated from validated performance models (Post-PSR). |
| **S-02** | MCRA Engine | Dynamic Maximum Risk Floor | Synthesized from CEE, PSR traces, RACM, and real-time **ECR** data. |
| **S-03** | C-15 Policy Engine | Policy Veto Flag (Boolean Constraint) | Must be definitively `FALSE`. Enforced via RSAM compliance rules. |

## I. GSEP: THE 7-STAGE ATOMIC EVOLUTION PROTOCOL (GCO Enforcement)

The GSEP provides the atomic, integrity-locked pathway from M-01 Intent to irreversible AIA Commitment (Stage 5).

| Stage # | Pillar Focus | Action Mandate / Lock Artifact | Critical Decision Point (EPDP) |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| **0** | Validation Root | Validate AOC Governance Source (GSH Lock). | N/A |
| **1** | Policy Vetting | Attest M-01 intent against RSAM constraints. | **EPDP A**: Policy Compliance Pass? |
| **2** | Integrity Lock | Verify M-02 integrity (PSIM), provenance, CEE, and RACM constraints. | N/A |
| **3** | Runtime Proofing | Execute rigorous sandbox simulation (PSR) to generate performance metrics. | **EPDP B**: Simulation Efficacy Pass? |
| **4** | **Adjudication** | Execute P-01 Calculus using ECR input (S-01 > S-02 & S-03=F). Final Gate Check. | **EPDP C**: P-01 Adjudication Pass? (DSCM Locked) |
| **5** | AIA Commitment | MCR executes irreversible cryptographic Version-Lock and D-01 logging. | N/A |
| **6** | Audit & Feedback | Secure activation (C-04), D-02/D-03 monitoring, and efficacy data collection. | N/A |
