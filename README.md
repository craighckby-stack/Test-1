# AGI Evolution Roadmap

# Roadmap
## Long-term Goals
The long-term goals for the kernel code include the following:
1.  **Integration with Governance Layer**: The kernel code should be integrated with the governance layer to ensure seamless policy execution and validation.
2.  **Constraint Optimization**: The constraint optimization framework should be further enhanced to handle complex constraints and optimize them for better performance.
3.  **Error Handling and Logging**: The kernel code should be updated to include robust error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure that any errors or issues are properly logged and handled.
4.  **Security Enhancements**: The kernel code should be reviewed and updated to ensure that it meets the required security standards and best practices.
5.  **Testing and Validation**: The kernel code should be thoroughly tested and validated to ensure that it works as expected and meets the required functionality and performance standards.
## Short-term Goals
The short-term goals for the kernel code include the following:
1.  **Update UseCycle Hook**: The useCycle hook should be updated to include the constraint optimization framework and to handle errors and logging properly.
2.  **Constraint Validation**: The constraint validation function should be updated to use the GAX library and to handle validation results properly.
3.  **Optimization Engine Integration**: The optimization engine should be integrated with the kernel code to optimize constraints and improve performance.
4.  **Code Refactoring**: The kernel code should be refactored to improve its readability, maintainability, and performance.
5.  **Documentation Updates**: The documentation for the kernel code should be updated to reflect any changes and to provide clear instructions for usage and integration.
