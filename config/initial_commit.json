  },
  "changes_summary": "Validated core API handling (429 resilience, timeouts). Confirmed robust JSON recovery logic. Established autonomous decision-making framework (target selection via LLM). Documented accurate capability baseline.",
  "reasoning": "Analysis confirmed explicit implementation of resilient features in App.js (v7.4.2), specifically exponential backoff for 429 errors and dedicated JSON recovery functions, warranting higher scores than the initial placeholders. Autonomy is rated 7 due to full self-directed cycle execution via GitHub APIs. Meta-Reasoning and Creativity remain low, awaiting dedicated algorithm implementation."
