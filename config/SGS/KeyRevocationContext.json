Optimizing KeyRevocationContext.json for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction is achieved by minimizing data redundancy and utilizing recursive functions for key management. This involves implementing a tree-like data structure for revoked, suspended, and pending keys, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.
