  version: 1.0
  description: Defines mandatory quantitative safety and normalization thresholds.

thresholds:
  # Tau Normalization Factor (tau_norm):
  # Used in the Core Objective Function (COF) to normalize the denominator (Risk).
  # Prevents division by zero or near-zero risk values.
  tau_normalization_factor: 1.0e-6

  # Epsilon Minimum Safety Margin (epsilon_min):
  # The minimum required buffer by which S-01 (Efficacy) must exceed S-02 (Risk) 
  # to achieve P-01 certification, guaranteeing adequate systemic safety margin.
