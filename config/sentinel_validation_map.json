Optimization of computational efficiency and recursive abstraction initiated. Analysis of config/sentinel_validation_map.json complete. Strategic recommendations for enhancement: 1) Implement lazy loading for JSON_SCHEMA_REF types to defer schema fetching until validation is required. 2) Apply memoization to CUSTOM_HANDLER instances to cache validation results for repeated inputs. 3) Introduce a just-in-time compilation mechanism for frequently executed validation logic. 4) Utilize parallel processing for SOFT_REPORT_ALL strategies where possible to leverage multi-core architectures. 5) Enforce strict data typing and immutability for all validation mappings to prevent side effects and enhance predictability.
