## Emergency Governance Override Module (EGOM) V97.0 Configuration

# EGOM handles mandatory governance conflicts, deadlocks, or critical failure states 
# requiring rapid triage, potentially initiating an auditable Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) review cycle 
# before GSEP Stage 1 (M-01 Intent Generation) can proceed.
