# Policy Correction Safety Schema (PCSS) V1.0
# Mandatory artifact for the GAX agent to derive safe, attested policy corrections during RRP.

  schema_version: 1.0
  custodian: GAX
  enforcement_target: VRRM remediation actions

# Constraints applied when modifying PVLM, MPAM, or ADTM due to an RRP failure (Ref 3.2)
policy_correction_axioms:

  # 1. Non-Degradation Constraint (NDE):
  # Utility baseline (S02) protection must not be reduced below the historical certified median.
  NDE_rule:
    affected_artifact: MPAM
    change_type: bounds_check
    constraint: utility_floor >= historic_median_S02

  # 2. Scope Minimization Constraint (SMC):
  # Changes must be localized to the veto artifact responsible for the failure (Veto Stage S(i)).
  SMC_rule:
    affected_artifact: PVLM, MPAM, ADTM
    change_type: specificity
    constraint: correction_scope <= 5% of manifest entries

  # 3. Certification Finality Anchor (CFA):
  # Any proposed correction must pass a dry-run test within the CPES Sandbox (S6.7) prior to VRRM finalization.
