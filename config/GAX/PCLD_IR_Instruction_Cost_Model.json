Optimization of the provided instruction cost model for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction is initiated. Analyzing the config/GAX/PCLD_IR_Instruction_Cost_Model.json file reveals a comprehensive set of instructions with their respective cycle and memory costs. The policy ceiling defines the maximum worst-case execution time (WCET) cycles and peak memory usage in kilobytes. To optimize, we can apply recursive abstraction by grouping instructions into categories based on their costs and applying optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, dead code elimination, and register allocation to minimize execution time and memory usage.
