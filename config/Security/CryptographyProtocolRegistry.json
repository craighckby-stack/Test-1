Optimization for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction is acknowledged. The provided CryptographyProtocolRegistry.json file will be processed with emphasis on enhancing performance and abstraction. The file's RegistryVersion is v95.0.0, indicating a recent update. Described as a centralized registry, it mandates cryptographic algorithms for Sovereign subsystems like SIPM, GSM, and TVCR. The Protocols section includes specifications for SGS/PQC-KEM-94B/ECDSA-P384 and CRoT-I-SHA3-512, detailing their primary algorithms, post-quantum candidates, key lengths, security levels, and statuses. The RequiredAgilityPolicy is set to AnnualReview, ensuring regular reassessments.
