## 1. Mandate: Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) TEDS Storage

The Forensic Vault Module (FVM) provides the dedicated, hardened storage layer essential for maintaining the integrity (Requirement 5.0) of all forensic artifacts, primarily the Total Execution Deterministic Snapshot (TEDS) generated by the FIA.

## 2. Security and Isolation Requirements

1.  **WORM Mechanism:** All committed data sets must enforce a permanent Write-Once-Read-Many storage policy. Data cannot be modified or deleted post-commitment.
2.  **Access Control:** The FVM enforces strict architectural isolation:
    *   **Write/Append Access:** Restricted solely to the Forensic Integrity Agent (FIA).
    *   **Read Access:** Restricted solely to the GAX Rollback Protocol (RRP) Analysis Module.
    *   **Denial:** All other execution agents or services are strictly denied access.
3.  **Integrity Indexing:** Every archived TEDS must be indexed and verifiable via its associated cryptographic hash (SHA-512 required).

## 3. Abstract API Endpoints

*   `FVM.commit(TEDS_archive, CRoT_signature)`: Initiates WORM storage operation.
*   `FVM.retrieve_by_hash(TEDS_hash)`: Safely retrieves the immutable archive.
*   `FVM.get_metadata(TEDS_hash)`: Retrieves archival timestamp and WORM lock status.
