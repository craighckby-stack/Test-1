Optimizations applied to utilities/SchemaValidator.py for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction include: 1) Utilizing memoization to cache frequently accessed schema validation results, 2) Implementing recursive descent parsing with tail call optimization to minimize function call overhead, and 3) Leveraging just-in-time compilation for performance-critical validation logic.
