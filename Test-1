The provided "CORE" code is written in Python, while the "NEW NODE" code is written in JavaScript (specifically, a React component). These are fundamentally different programming languages and frameworks that cannot be directly merged into a single file in the way you've requested.

The Python code defines a backend-like core logic for a "Sovereign Engine" (enums, config, state management, simulated API calls, file processing). The JavaScript code defines a frontend React application that would *interact* with such a backend, using Firebase, GitHub API, and potentially the `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` (Gemini API).

To achieve what you might be intending, you would either need to:

1.  **Port the JavaScript logic to Python:** Reimplement all the React component's state, effects, API interactions, and UI-driven logic into Python functions and classes that could potentially integrate with the existing Python core. This would involve a complete rewrite of the JavaScript logic in Python.
2.  **Integrate them as separate components:** The Python core would run as a backend service, and the React application would run as a frontend, communicating with the Python backend via an API (e.g., RESTful endpoints). This is the standard architectural approach for such systems.

Since a direct merge is impossible, and I am instructed to "Return ONLY the complete, single-file code", I cannot fulfill this request by combining the two disparate codebases. Please clarify if you intended a full port of the JavaScript logic to Python, or if you had a different integration strategy in mind.
