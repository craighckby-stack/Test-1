To optimize the provided RDM_Optimizer for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction, several adjustments can be considered. Firstly, incorporating memoization or caching for the `_get_scaling_factor` method can help reduce redundant calculations when similar utilization values are encountered. Additionally, using NumPy for vectorized operations can enhance performance in methods like `calculate_scope`. Moreover, employing a more efficient data structure, such as a trie, for the optimization parameters in `update_dsp_c` could minimize the overhead of file IO operations. Lastly, abstracting the recursive nature of the simulation scope calculation into a separate, reusable function can improve code modularity and reusability. These optimizations aim to improve the overall efficiency and scalability of the RDM_Optimizer.
