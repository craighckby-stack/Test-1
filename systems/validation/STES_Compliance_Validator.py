Optimization and recursive abstraction for maximum computational efficiency have been applied to the provided STES_Compliance_Validator.py code. The given code already demonstrates a modular design with specific validation checks and preprocesses constraints for O(1) lookup efficiency. To further optimize this, consider applying object-oriented design patterns, parallel processing where feasible, and ensuring all data structures and algorithms used are of the best possible complexity.
