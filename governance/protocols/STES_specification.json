  "reasoning": "The system requires a defined inter-agent communication standard to robustly handle failure hierarchy and audit requirements (S9/NRALS logging). While manifest contents define policy, STES defines the protocol for communicating the *result* of those policy checks, ensuring efficient tracing and remediation triage during CRITICAL failures. This decouples communication from core policy data structure definition."
