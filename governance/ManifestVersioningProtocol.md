# Governance Manifest Integrity Protocol (GMIP) V2.0 SPECIFICATION
## Successor to Manifest Versioning and Attestation Protocol (MVAP) V1.0

## 1.0 PROTOCOL MANDATE: SECURE STATE TRANSITION MANAGEMENT

The GMIP ensures auditable, non-repudiable state synchronization for all mutations applied to Governance Asset Control Registry (GACR) critical manifests (PVLM, MPAM, ECVM, CFTM). This cryptographic sealing prevents repudiation of governance policy state transitions, satisfying requirements for GSEP-C Veto Gates.

## 2.0 CORE ASSETS & DEPENDENCIES

### 2.1 Manifest Content Root Hash ($ M_H $)
The definitive identifier for any manifest state $ M $ is its Content Root Hash ($ M_H $). $ M_H $ is the deterministic Merkle root generated from the canonical serialization of $ M $ content, defined strictly by the **Manifest Canonicalization Standard (MCS)**.

*   **Integrity Guarantee:** Any change to $ M $ necessitates a new, unique $ M_H $.
*   **Dependency:** Defined by `config/ManifestCanonicalizationStandard.json`.

### 2.2 Manifest Hash Chain (MHC)
$ M_H $ must contain metadata linking to the previous active manifest hash, $ M_{H, N-1} $, thus forming a verifiable, cryptographically enforced Manifest Hash Chain (MHC).

### 2.3 Manifest Attestation Signature (MAS)
The MAS is the cryptographic signature of $ M_H $ generated by the designated Governance Asset Signing Key (ASK) chain, certifying the authenticity and policy alignment of the manifest by the Root of Trust (CRoT).

## 3.0 GMIP STATE TRANSITION MODEL

All manifest updates must progress through the following three formal, monotonic states:

### State 1: PROPOSAL ($ M'_H $, Pending)
| Step | Action | Required Artifacts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1.1 | **Initiation & Generation** | Proposed Manifest ($ M'$) |
| 1.2 | **Pre-Validation & Hashing** | Structural check against GICM. Provisional $ M'_H $ calculated (via MCS). |

### State 2: CERTIFICATION ($ M_{H} $, Attested)
| Step | Action | Required Artifacts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2.1 | **CRoT Attestation** | CRoT signs $ M'_H $ using the ASK chain, generating the Manifest Attestation Signature (MAS). |
| 2.2 | **Immutability Commit** | The attested object $ \{M', MAS\} $ is immediately logged to the Non-Repudiable Audit Log System (NRALS), confirming linkage via MHC. |

### State 3: ACTIVATION ($ M_{H} $, Active)
| Step | Action | Required Artifacts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3.1 | **Eligibility Check** | Must possess a valid, NRALS-committed MAS. |
| 3.2 | **System Load** | $ M_{H} $ is loaded by GSEP-C S0 (ANCHOR INIT) and becomes the current standard for enforcement. |

## 4.0 OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1.  **MCS Standardization:** The MCS must remain universally defined and immutable to ensure $ M_H $ collision resistance and reproducibility across all operational environments.
2.  **Rollback Assurance:** Previous attested states $ M_{H, N-1} $ and associated MAS must be retained for instant access, strictly adhering to mandated Rollback and Recovery Procedures (RRP/SIH).
