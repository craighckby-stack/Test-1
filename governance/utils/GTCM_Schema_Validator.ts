Optimizing GTCM schema validation for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction involves leveraging advanced TypeScript features and libraries. One approach is to utilize a combination of recursive functions and memoization to minimize redundant computations. Below is an optimized version of the GTCM schema validation code:
