Optimizing for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction, the provided code serves as a foundation for an Abstract Scaling Engine. To further improve efficiency and abstraction, consider integrating memoization for the calculate_scaling_factor and calculate_omega methods to cache results of expensive function calls and avoid redundant calculations. Moreover, implementing a recursive approach for calculating Omega could enhance the engine's ability to handle complex governance schemas.
