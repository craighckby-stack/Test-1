Optimization for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction of the provided FTL_Schema.json is achieved through strict adherence to the defined schema, leveraging JSON Schema draft-07 for validation and ensuring data integrity. The recursive abstraction is inherently supported by the nested structure of the 'failure_context' and 'diagnostic_trace' properties, allowing for a detailed, hierarchical representation of failure data.
