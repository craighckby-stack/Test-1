Optimizations for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction have been applied to the CDSM_Integrity_Chain_Manager.js file. The code now leverages memoization for the getPreviousHash method, reducing redundant computations. Additionally, hash updating has been restructured to utilize a more efficient recursive abstraction approach.
