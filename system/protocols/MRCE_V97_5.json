Ensures automated, immediate stabilization or quarantine measures are applied to the relevant models (CMR entries) before the next GSEP-C cycle commences.",

    "MPAM Veto (S3) exceeding CFTM thresholds for $ S_{04} $ failure rate over N cycles.",
    "MDMP post-audit critical drift detection."

    "level_1": "Automatic constraint application (rate limiting or complexity capping) on the unstable model, logged to CALS.",
    "level_2": "Temporary suspension of the model from S7 metric generation, forcing fallback to certified prior-generation model.",
    "level_3": "Model quarantine, requiring mandatory human-supervised PEUP validation/retraining before re-entry into CMR."
