Optimization for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction in IH_Sentinel.py achieved through: (1) minimization of redundant checks, (2) implementation of Abstract Base Classes for modular extension, and (3) utilization of exception handling for fast-fail error propagation. Further enhancements could involve parallel processing of audits and critical flag checks using concurrent.futures, or integration of machine learning models for predictive anomaly detection.
