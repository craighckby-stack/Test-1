Optimization Strategy: To optimize for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction, the PreflightArtifactProcessor class can be refactored to utilize memoization, lazy loading, and functional composition. The runPreflight method can be broken down into smaller, reusable functions, each responsible for a specific step in the workflow. The _retrieveArtifact and _checkIntegrity methods can be implemented using dynamic dispatch and higher-order functions to reduce code duplication and improve modularity.
