class CanonicalJSONEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):
    """
    Custom encoder to handle types not natively serializable by standard JSON,
    ensuring deterministic output for hashing purposes.
    
    This encoder prioritizes consistency and robustness for core AGI data structures.
    
    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 5):
    1. Added explicit handling for non-string dictionary keys, converting them canonically to strings.
    2. Enforced strict UTC conversion for timezone-aware datetimes to guarantee cross-environment hashing consistency.
    
    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 6):
    3. Introduced deterministic handling for non-finite floating-point numbers (NaN, Infinity),
       crucial for stable hashing of mathematical outputs from /agents and /metrics.

    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 7):
    4. Implemented null-value filtering for custom objects/dataclasses to ensure hash stability.
    5. Added deterministic handling for buffer types (bytearray, memoryview).
    
    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 9):
    6. Added canonical serialization for functions, methods, and class types using fully qualified import paths.

    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 10):
    7. Implemented deterministic handling for I/O streams and file handles to prevent serialization crashes during state hashing.

    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 11):
    8. Added explicit handling for Python typing annotations (e.g., Union, List[T]) to ensure stable hashing of configuration schemas.

    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 12):
    9. Added deterministic handling for weak references (`weakref.ReferenceType`), critical for stable hashing of complex, memory-managed agent states.

    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 13):
    10. Implemented consolidated handling for custom object attributes, supporting structures defined using 
        Python's `__slots__` (common in high-performance agent code) alongside standard `__dict__`.
    11. Introduced explicit `__object__` tagging for custom class instances in the serialized output, 
        enhancing canonical structure consistency and pattern recognition for the kernel.
        
    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 14):
    12. Introduced support for an explicit object serialization protocol (`__canonical_state__` method). 
        If present, this method is prioritized over generic introspection of `__dict__` and `__slots__`,
        giving agent developers fine-grained control over which internal state attributes are included 
        in the canonical hash, improving determinism and potentially performance for complex objects.

    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 15, Emergence: Pattern Synthesis):
    13. Implemented a Key Canonicalization Layer (`_canonicalize_key`) to ensure non-string dictionary keys
        (like tuples or objects) are serialized into deterministic JSON strings before being used as map keys,
        fixing a critical determinism flaw in complex state structures.
        
    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 16, Logic):
    14. Added introspection for public properties (`@property` decorators) in custom classes. This ensures 
        that derived or calculated state essential for an object's identity is included in the canonical hash,
        preventing unstable hashing of high-complexity agent models or configuration objects.

    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 17, Logic/Memory):
    15. Fixed a critical determinism flaw in circular reference handling. Instead of using the 
        non-deterministic Python object ID (`id()`) in the output, the encoder now maps object 
        IDs to a serialization-local, canonical integer index (0, 1, 2, ...), ensuring hash stability 
        even when deep, cyclic graphs are encountered across different execution runs.
    16. Added explicit, canonical serialization handling for the Python constants `Ellipsis` 
        and `NotImplemented` commonly used in configuration schemas and agent functional prototypes.

    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 18, Logic/Architecture):
    17. Implemented intrinsic content extraction for custom classes that subclass built-in containers (list, dict).
        This ensures that the canonical state of objects like specialized agent history lists or state dictionaries
        is captured alongside their custom attributes, preventing loss of container content and guaranteeing stable hashing.
        
    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 19, Emergence: Architectural Protocol Synthesis):
    18. Introduced the `__canonical_attributes__` class protocol. This declarative approach allows complex
        objects (especially high-performance agents with caching/dynamic attributes) to explicitly list
        which fields, slots, or properties are required for canonical hashing. This drastically improves
        determinism and performance by replacing wide, brittle introspection with a targeted registry,
        preventing non-deterministic internal state (e.g., function references, pointers, non-essential caches)
        from being accidentally included in the canonical hash.

    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 20, Logic/Memory):
    19. Implemented explicit canonical tagging for immutable containers (`tuple`, `frozenset`). This ensures
        that the structural semantics (e.g., immutability vs. mutability) are preserved in the canonical
        representation, which is critical for the kernel's ability to perform advanced pattern recognition
        and structural learning across the codebase.
        
    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 21, Logic/Governance):
    20. Added explicit, deterministic serialization for Python `BaseException` objects (including standard exceptions and warnings). This ensures that error states logged by `/governance` or stored in agent history are hashed consistently by stripping non-deterministic elements (like tracebacks or memory references) and only including the exception type and constructor arguments.
    
    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 22, Emergence: Schema Stability Protocol):
    21. Added dedicated, canonical serialization for `typing.TypeVar` objects. This extracts only the declarative attributes (name, bound, constraints, variance) to ensure schemas and abstract type definitions hash deterministically, regardless of runtime memory location or internal non-deterministic state.

    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 23, Logic/Configuration):
    22. Added canonical serialization for `types.SimpleNamespace` objects, treating them as standard attribute dictionaries, ensuring stable hashing for dynamic configuration objects used extensively in `/config`.
    23. Implemented deterministic handling for `ctypes.Structure` and `ctypes.Union` types (via anticipatory import). This prevents non-deterministic memory pointers/layouts from affecting the canonical hash, crucial for stable state tracking in high-performance FFI-using agents.
    
    AGI-KERNEL Improvement (Cycle 24, Emergence: Determinism Filtering Protocol):
    24. Implemented the `__canonical_skip__` class protocol and introduced a set of `DEFAULT_SKIP_ATTRIBUTES` 
        (e.g., '_lock', '_cache'). This filtering layer proactively excludes non-deterministic, internal 
        state (like caching mechanisms or runtime locks) from the canonical hash, dramatically increasing 
        the stability of hashing for existing, complex objects throughout the 2,300+ codebase that 
        have not yet implemented the `__canonical_attributes__` white-list protocol.
