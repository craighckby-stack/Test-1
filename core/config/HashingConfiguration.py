Optimization of HashingConfiguration.py for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction is crucial. The DEFAULT_ALGORITHM is set to 'sha256', which is a widely used and efficient hashing algorithm. The STANDARD_EXCLUSIONS set is defined to exclude transient and environment-specific keys from artifact dictionaries, ensuring determinism in canonical hashes. The MAX_HASH_LENGTH is set to 64, corresponding to SHA-256/512 lengths, which provides a reasonable balance between security and efficiency.
