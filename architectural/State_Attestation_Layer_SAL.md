# State Attestation Layer (SAL) Protocol V1.0

## M.0 MISSION: Integrity Persistence and Non-Repudiation

The SAL protocol defines the mandatory, tamper-proof persistence layer for all audit, finality, and policy-update artifacts generated by the SGS Core. SAL ensures the Non-Repudiable Audit Log Specification (NRALS, defined by CALS) remains cryptographically anchored, verifiable, and immutable.

## 1.0 ARCHITECTURE AND DEPENDENCIES

1.  **Input Source:** Stage S8 (Audit Log Persistence) and all PEUP transactions.
2.  **Required Assets:** CALS (Schema), CRoT (Signing Key).
3.  **Storage Mandate:** Must utilize a cryptographic ledger (e.g., distributed hash graph or Merkle tree persistence) independent of the primary SGS state machine, managed by the CRoT domain.

## 2.0 SAL CERTIFICATION PROCESS

For any input payload $P$, SAL mandates the following sequence before storage commitment:

1.  **Schema Validation:** $P$ must conform strictly to the CALS specification.
2.  **Time Stamping:** Apply cryptographically verified timestamp (GATM constraint).
3.  **CRoT Signing:** $P$ is signed by the current CRoT signing key, yielding $P_{sig}$.
4.  **Ledger Commitment:** $P_{sig}$ is committed to the immutable persistence layer, returning an verifiable anchor hash ($H_{anchor}$). The successful generation of $H_{anchor}$ constitutes the final output of S8 and the validation requirement for all PEUP transactions.

## 3.0 Integrity Verification

The SAL must expose a verified endpoint for external audit, enabling any party to verify the integrity of any archived state transition (NRALS record) by recalculating the Merkle path back to the established Root of Trust $H_{anchor}$.
