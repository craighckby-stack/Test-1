# DIAL: DSE Integrity Analyzer Specification v1.0

## 0. MISSION

The DIAL utility is mandatory for performing deterministic Root Cause Analysis (RCA) following an Integrity Halt (IH) event within the DSE Protocol. DIAL ensures verifiability of the failure path before system recovery can be authorized.

## I. INPUT DATA SCHEMA (IH Artifacts)

DIAL requires the complete set of integrity artifacts generated by the GSEP-C pipeline immediately prior to the IH event, alongside all structured logs.

| Artifact ID | Source Stage | Purpose | Schema Requirement |
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|
| **CSR** | S01 | Configuration Policy Snapshot | Must be provided in immutable format (e.g., hashed JSON). |
| **ECVM** | S07 | Execution Context Map | Verification of environmental and permission constraints. |
| **TEMM** | S08 | Efficacy Measure | Required scalar value ($\Omega$) for GAX I utility threshold analysis. |
| **Logs** | All Stages | Structured Failure Logs | Time-series data, indexed by Failure Trace ID (MPAM, SGS, ADTM). |

## II. RCA METHODOLOGY

DIAL executes a comparison-based deterministic analysis:

1.  **Baseline Retrieval:** Retrieve the verified system configuration baseline preceding the execution attempt.
2.  **Constraint Differential:** Compare the IH artifacts (CSR, ECVM, TEMM) against the expected validated baseline parameters. Identify the precise deviation that violated the first GAX.
3.  **Trace Mapping:** Map the specific GAX violation back into the structured Logs using the Failure Trace ID (ADTM/SGS/MPAM) to identify the specific operation or input payload responsible for the deviation.

## III. OUTPUT: IMMUTABLE FAULT REPORT (JSON)

DIAL must generate a signed, immutable JSON report committed to the external ledger to authorize any subsequent RRP or recovery protocol execution.
