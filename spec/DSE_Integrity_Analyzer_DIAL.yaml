# DIAL Specification: DSE Integrity Analyzer Utility

version: 1.0
protocol_dependency: DSE V94.6

interface:
  function: analyze_halt
  description: Executes deterministic Root Cause Analysis (RCA) on an Integrity Halt (IH) event.
  
input_schema:
  required_artifacts: # Integrity Locks generated during GSEP-C flow
    - CSR (Configuration Snapshot Receipt) # GAX III
    - ECVM (Execution Context Validation Map) # GAX II
    - TEMM (Transition Efficacy Measure) # GAX I
  required_logs: # Structured failure traces
    - MPAM (Matrix Policy Abstraction Map)
    - SGS (System Governance Snapshot)
    - ADTM (Axiomatic Drift Threshold Metric)

execution_mandate:
  - Must execute RCA deterministically based solely on provided inputs.
  - Must be immutable (write-once) operationally.
  - Must provide a definitive trace path linking failure logs (MPAM, SGS, ADTM) back to the relevant artifact (CSR, ECVM, TEMM) failure point.
  
output_schema:
  report_type: Immutable Fault Report (IFR)
  content:
    - halt_stage: S[xx] (Stage where IH occurred)
    - failing_axiom: GAX [I, II, or III]
    - definitive_root_cause_id: Hash identifying the causal event within the trace logs.
    - final_rollback_status: RRP completion status.
