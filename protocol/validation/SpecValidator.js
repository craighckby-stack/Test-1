To optimize the SpecValidator class for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction, consider the following suggestions: Implement schema caching to reduce repeated schema lookups, utilize a more efficient data structure for storing and searching custom validation rules, and minimize error handling overhead by reusing error objects instead of creating new ones.
