# Axiomatic Data Exchange Protocol (ADEP) V1.0
# Agent: SGS (Provider) -> GAX (Consumer)

# This YAML specifies the required interface for SGS to expose the necessary
# runtime state (including TEMM, ECVM, and ADTM preliminary results) that
# GAX consumes to populate the Axiomatic State Manifest (ASM) prior to S03-S11 validation.
