PGN_VERSION: 1.0.0
PROTOCOL_NAME: Policy_Governance_Nexus_Specification
DESCRIPTION: Defines the process and cryptographic requirements for validating, loading, and updating foundational protocol configuration artifacts (GAX, PIM, ACVM, Cryptographic Manifest).

# I. ARTIFACT SIGNATURE REQUIREMENTS
ARTIFACTS_TO_GOVERN:
  GAX_MASTER:
    PATH: protocol/gax_master.yaml
    SIGNATURE_MIN_LEVEL: L4_CRITICAL
    VERIFICATION_ACTOR: EMSU (at G0 pre-lock)
  PIM_CONSTRAINTS:
    PATH: config/pim_constraints.json
    SIGNATURE_MIN_LEVEL: L3_HIGH
  ACVM_CONFIGURATION:
    PATH: config/acvm.json
    SIGNATURE_MIN_LEVEL: L3_HIGH

# II. UPDATE PROTOCOL (Required for GAX III Compliance)
UPDATE_SEQUENCE:
  - STEP: 1 (Proposal)
    MANDATE: Distributed consensus signature required on proposed artifact hash.
  - STEP: 2 (Pre-Lock Validation)
    MANDATE: PIM verifies the governance signature chain against the PGN policy at S00, ensuring the loaded configuration is the correctly attested version for the Epoch Manifest Seal (EMS).
  - STEP: 3 (Post-Epoch Commitment)
    MANDATE: The new artifact version is activated only after the successful GAX I seal of the prior epoch (G3).
