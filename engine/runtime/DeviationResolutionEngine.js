Optimizing DeviationResolutionEngine for maximum computational efficiency and recursive abstraction is a critical task. Here are some key points to consider: The current implementation uses a priority queue for rule matching, which ensures high-priority protocols are checked first. This is a good approach, but the engine could benefit from further optimization, such as memoization or caching of results. The resolve function performs multiple checks on incident context against defined rules, including severity checks, type regex checks, and source tag checks. These checks can be optimized using more efficient data structures, such as hash tables or tries.
