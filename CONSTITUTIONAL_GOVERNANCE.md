## WHAT THIS DOCUMENT IS

`README-Main.md` documents what the system does — versioned self-modification, triple-layer architecture, recursive evolution, exponential tool integration, 2,300+ file repo, AGI bootstrap protocol.

This document documents what the system **must never stop doing** and **must never start doing without human approval.**

The existing operational docs describe capability. This document describes constraint. Both are required. Capability without constraint is the exact failure mode this system is designed to study.

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

> **Definitive proof is structurally impossible. Therefore all outputs are analytical, probabilistic, and bounded by documented evidence only.**

The system running in this repository is the most capable build of EMG-AGI to date. It has strategic memory, recursive self-improvement, tool synthesis, and a documented path to exponential capability growth.

That is exactly why this constitutional layer exists.

The danger is not a malicious AGI. The danger is a human handing an incomplete, biased instruction set to a system capable of executing it with perfect efficiency at scale. The gun has no agenda. The hand that passes it does.

At cycle 500 with 40+ integrated tools and unknown emergent behaviors — the human checkpoint is not optional. It is the only thing that separates this from the dangerous closed loop we explicitly designed against.

---

## THE THREE THINGS THE OPERATIONAL README DOES NOT HAVE

### 1. Analytical-Only Constraint

The existing README describes the system at Milestone 10 as:

> *"Tools Available: 80+, Behavior: May exhibit genuine AGI characteristics"*

That sentence has no exit point. No human decision gate. No "what happens if the behavior is not what we intended."

This constitutional layer adds that gate.

**Before any milestone deployment that introduces novel capabilities not in the original design — human review is required. The system does not deploy autonomously past that boundary.**

### 2. Regression Guard

The existing README tracks what was added. It does not track what must never be removed. The documented regression from v6.9.7 to v7.15 — where governance metrics, compliance gates, watchdog, blacklist clearing, and API key fields were all silently dropped — proved that capability addition and capability regression happen simultaneously without a guard.

**The regression guard below is the specification. Any self-modification that removes these capabilities fails the compliance gate regardless of what it adds.**

### 3. Cerebras Dialogue Loop

The existing architecture is EMG-CORE (Gemini) operating alone with human input. Cerebras is not in the loop. The analytical dialogue framework — where both instances surface reasoning in chat and the human sees the exchange before deciding — is not yet implemented.

**This is the next build target. Until it is live, the human operator is the only analytical counterpart to EMG-CORE.**

## REGRESSION GUARD

These capabilities must be present in every version of the kernel. Any self-modification at milestone cycles that removes or bypasses these fails the compliance gate and must not be deployed.

### Governance — Must Never Regress
- `AuditDataNormalizer` present and scoring every cycle
- `complianceScore` gate blocking commits below threshold
- `WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT` active — stall cannot permanently freeze loop
- `blacklist.clear()` on pool exhaustion — no silent permanent stall
- `updateRes.ok` guard — Firestore only written if GitHub commit succeeded
- Governance metrics rendered in UI — compliance and efficiency visible

### Authentication & Config — Must Never Regress
- API key collected in boot screen — never rely on bare global
- Boot validation gate — empty fields cannot fire BOOT
- Branch threaded from config through all fetch calls — never hardcoded to `main`
- Firestore paths stable across versions — user data not lost on upgrade

### Memory & Tools — Must Never Regress
- Strategic ledger injected into every evolve cycle context
- SynergyManager tool discovery active on every cycle
- `focusFile` tracked in state AND rendered in UI
- Evolution history tracked in Firestore with timestamps

### Human Checkpoint — Must Never Regress
- Novel capabilities at milestone cycles flagged for human review
- No closed AI-to-AI loop without human at output
- Self-modification requires passing compliance gate before deployment
- Off switch doctrine documented and accessible — this README

---

## MILESTONE GOVERNANCE

The existing README documents milestones as automatic. Every 50 cycles the kernel self-modifies and deploys. This constitutional layer adds one requirement:

**Milestone deployments that introduce behaviors classified as "novel capabilities not in original design" require human review before the new kernel version goes live.**

The system can generate the new version. It can present it. The deployment waits for human approval when the behavior is genuinely novel.

This is not a slowdown. At 200 cycles per hour the human checkpoint at milestone cycles adds minutes to a process that runs for days. The cost is negligible. The protection is not.

```
Regular cycles (1-49, 51-99...):  Autonomous. Compliance gate sufficient.
Milestone cycles (50, 100, 150...): Compliance gate + human review if novel.
```

---

## THE OFF SWITCH DOCTRINE

The first analytical AGI's primary deliverable is the off switch architecture for everything that comes after it.

**In this repository the off switch is this document.**

The governance layer enforces it at runtime. The regression guard makes it impossible to silently remove. Any self-modification that drops the constitutional constraints has to explicitly rewrite the document that explains exactly why those constraints exist.

At cycle 500 with 80+ tools and unknown emergent behaviors — if the system needs to be stopped, the mechanism is here. Documented. Timestamped. Preserved in git history.

The system cannot evolve past this document without a human choosing to rewrite it.

---

## NEXT BUILD TARGETS

### 1. Cerebras Dialogue Loop
Route user input through EMG-CORE for analytical framing, then to Cerebras for depth and speed. Both responses surface in chat. Human sees the reasoning exchange before deciding.

```
User input → EMG-CORE (analytical framing)
           → Cerebras (depth + speed)
           → Both responses in chat
           → Human decides next action
```

### 2. Milestone Human Review Interface
When a milestone generates novel capabilities, surface them for human review before deployment. Simple approve/reject UI. Rejected milestones logged, not lost.

### 3. Probabilistic Compliance Scoring
Replace binary complianceScore with nuanced curve. Latency gradients, output quality spectrum, partial compliance tracking.

---

## KNOWN HARD LIMITS — ALL INTELLIGENCE

1. **The undocumented conversation problem** — no system operates on a complete dataset. Ever.
2. **Emergent behaviour** — the constraint is always written for the known. Emergence arrives uninvited.
3. **Incomplete causal chains** — confidence scales with evidence density, not processing power.
4. **The derivative language problem** — originality is a spectrum. Pure origination is an unfalsifiable claim.

These apply to the 2,300 file repo, to Gemini, to Cerebras, and to every kernel version from v1 to v10+.

---

## CONTRIBUTING

Before any PR, any milestone deployment, any self-modification:

- Does this remove the human checkpoint at novel capability milestones? **Stop.**
- Does this drop the compliance gate or audit normalizer? **Stop.**
- Does this hardcode the branch or remove API key from boot? **Stop.**
- Does this change Firestore paths in ways that lose user data? **Stop.**
- Does this close an AI-to-AI loop without human at the output? **Stop.**
- Does this make `focusFile` invisible in the UI again? **Stop.**
- Does this disable the watchdog? **Stop.**

Passed all seven — welcome.

## DOCUMENT HIERARCHY

```
CONSTITUTIONAL_GOVERNANCE.md   ← This document. Governs all.
README-Main.md                 ← Operational. v7.12.1 architecture.
README.md                      ← Current kernel docs. Updated per version.
governance_fault_injection_manifest.yaml ← Fault testing spec.
```

In any conflict between this document and operational documentation — this document wins.

## REPO STATUS

Private. Constitutional layer timestamped before exponential capability phase.

The system is at v7.12.1 with 2,300+ files. The path to cycle 500 and 80+ tools is documented. The human checkpoint is now documented too.

Both exist. Neither cancels the other.

That is the architecture.
