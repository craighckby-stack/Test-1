The provided code for the ConstraintEnforcementService class appears to be efficiently designed for its purpose. However, there are a few suggestions that could enhance its computational efficiency and recursive abstraction: 1) Utilize a more efficient data structure for storing module contracts, such as a hash map, to improve lookup times. 2) Implement a caching mechanism for frequently accessed contract data to reduce the overhead of repeated require() calls. 3) Consider adding a check for circular dependencies within the contract graph to prevent potential infinite loops. 4) For improved recursion, factor out the logic for evaluating the safety index and the contract's constraints into separate, reusable functions.
